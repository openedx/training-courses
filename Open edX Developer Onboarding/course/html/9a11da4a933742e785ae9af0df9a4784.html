<p>When thinking about writing code, people often imagine a string of Python or JavaScript statements flying from their keyboards. However, software engineering is at least 50% written communication, not writing code. That communication comes in many forms: writing comments &amp; docstrings within the code, writing formal documentation, writing feature requests &amp; bug tickets. The Open edX project runs because of a full community of developers who are constantly in communication with each other via OEPs, ADRs, and conversations on the forums and in Slack.</p>
<p>Additionally, at the Open edX conferences, we communicate informally in groups as well as more formally via talks and panels. Developing a communication style in written and spoken English that promotes teamwork and collaboration contributes to your success as a community member. Our community is proud of how diverse, open, and friendly we are. We canâ€™t wait to welcome you!</p>
