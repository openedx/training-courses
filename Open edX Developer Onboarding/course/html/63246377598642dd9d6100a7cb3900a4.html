<h3><strong>Product Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Before we dive into what the project’s architecture looks like, it’s important to understand a bit of the product that we’re building. You’ll hear a lot about the Product Working Group, product roadmap, and Core Product as you develop features for the platform. What are these?</p>
<p>Within the Open edX project, we define core organizational principles and major architecture decisions in documents called "<strong>Open edX Proposals</strong>", or, "<strong>OEPs</strong>". We tackled the problem of our huge software product in an OEP called <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0057-proc-core-product.html" target="_blank">OEP-57 </a>that sought to define the core product of our project. OEP-57 was written by members of the Product Working Group, a collection of product managers and engineers who work to define and implement the next generation features of the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Important parts of OEP-57, providing some context to the “Core Product”, are as follows: </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the Open edX project began in 2012, the number of features and ways to use the platform has proliferated. It has become increasingly difficult to build releases, get up and running with a new Open edX instance, and simply approach the platform as a new user. Recent efforts have thought about the platform holistically, defining different community use cases and how the platform might best serve those communities’ needs. This work has identified that the Open edX project needs to be focused on defining, developing, and supporting a core set of functionality and associated extensions.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Core Product</em></strong> is defined as a clear articulation of which features, experiences and use cases come fully supported by the default configuration of the community-maintained Open edX installation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Core Product</strong> is defined by a set of people across the community, driven by the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3449028609/Product+Working+Group" target="[object Object]">Product Working Group</a>. It is based on user and market input. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of defining the <strong>Core Product</strong> is to ensure that we prioritize building, improving, and fixing a set of features that are important to the broadest section of our community. The Product Roadmap defines which features are in progress or need to be built out that will enhance the Core Product in a way that’s applicable to all users of the platform.</p>
<p>Different users (such as math instructors and corporate trainers) are going to have wildly different needs when it comes to how they author courses and run their platforms. That's why we also have a concept called <strong>Official Extensions</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Official Extensions</strong> are components outside of the Core Product that the Open edX community believes:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Fulfill a need that is consistently expressed by multiple community members</li>
<li>Can be effectively maintained by the community.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
