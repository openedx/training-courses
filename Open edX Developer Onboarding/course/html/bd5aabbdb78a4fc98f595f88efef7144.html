<h3><strong>Django Settings </strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a large number of settings are implemented as Django settings. The edx-platform documentation contains a list of <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform/en/latest/references/settings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available Django settings</a>. Note, however, that the list does not contain Django settings that act as toggles (we’ll discuss toggles in the next section) and only contains <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edx-platform</a> settings. Settings for other services and apps are not listed in this document; for those, you’ll need to inspect the settings files in the GitHub repository corresponding to the service/app you’re looking for.</p>
<p>To modify custom Django settings in Tutor, you need to create a Tutor plugin. The Tutor documentation contains a <a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/tutorials/plugin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorial about it</a>, so we are not going to go through all the steps here.</p>
<p>Once your plugin with custom settings is ready and installed, you need to save the Tutor configuration with Tutor config save and restart it by running <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;">tutor local restart</span> for local installation, or <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;">tutor k8s start</span> when deployed in Kubernetes.</p>
