<h3><strong>Who is this course for? </strong></h3>
<p>Individuals who want to write code for the Open edX platform should take this course. We assume familiarity with programming concepts and one or more programming languages. In Module 6: Reference Material, Tutorials &amp; How-Tos, we provide resources for getting up to speed with our primary languages, frameworks, and technologies (such as Python, Django, React, and Git) but this course does not teach these concepts. While the basic content is aimed at junior developers, we provide resources for those who wish to dig deeper into the various topics.</p>
<p>We also include a section (<a href="/jump_to_id/607e54c8720d4611b686858fe0cf6151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Module 3: Site Operations</a>) aimed at those who intend to deploy, run, and manage an Open edX instance. For that module, you should be comfortable with Linux and the command line. You do not need to take the other modules in the course if you only want to learn about site operations, although you may find them useful.</p>
<p>In order to develop code for the Open edX environment, you will need a computer running Mac OSX (currently supported architectures - Intel [x86_64] (through 2025) or Apple Silicon [arm64]) or a Linux distribution (weâ€™ve had success with Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora). Development for the Open edX platform is not supported on Windows.</p>
