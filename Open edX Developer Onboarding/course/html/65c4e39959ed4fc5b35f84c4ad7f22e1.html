<h4><strong>Who is this module for? </strong></h4>
<p>Before we get started, let’s explain how the various intended audiences should approach completing this section of the course. This module is comprised of four sub-modules:</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li><strong>The Open edX project repositories overview</strong> introduces the main repositories of the Open edX project. More experienced developers should check out the Learn More boxes, which provide some deeper information about some of our 200+ repos.</li>
<li><strong>How We Version Control</strong> explores Git and common commands such as forking and cloning. Our repos use a rebasing workflow - if you’re familiar with Git, but are new to rebasing, don’t miss these units. Power Git users can skip this sub-module.</li>
<li><strong>Development Best Practices</strong> discusses testing, debugging, code linting, and Conventional Commits. More experienced developers might browse through this sub-module, focusing only on the Learn More boxes.</li>
<li><strong>Coding is Writing</strong> describes the Open edX community standards when it comes to open, friendly communication. This sub-module also covers the Open edX project standards on docstrings, comments, feature requests, and bug reports. All Open edX developers should read through this sub-module carefully in order to align with how the Open edX project functions.</li>
