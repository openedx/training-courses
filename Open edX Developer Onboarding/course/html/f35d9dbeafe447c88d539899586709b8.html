<p>As mentioned earlier in this course, the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/1022099494/Build-Test-Release+BTR+Working+Group" target="_blank">Build/Test/Release Working Group</a> publishes new major stable Open edX releases twice a year (in June and December). Minor releases with security patches and bug fixes are released in between major releases, roughly every two months. When a new major release is published, the old one is no longer supported and stops getting updates. To ensure the stability and security of your Open edX deployment, you should install new releases and keep your instances up to date.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/1022099494/Build-Test-Release+BTR+Working+Group" target="_blank">Build/Test/Release Working Group</a> works closely with Tutor developers to ensure that a new Tutor version that supports the latest major release gets published immediately after the release is finalized.</p>
<p>You may want to keep a watch on the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OEPM/pages/4191191044/Open+edX+Releases+Homepage" target="_blank">Open edX Releases Homepage</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/releases" target="_blank">Tutor Releases page</a> for information about new releases.</p>
<p>One of the nicest things about Tutor is that it automates upgrade procedures from one Open edX release to the next as much as possible.</p>
<p>To upgrade, you simply install a new version of Tutor, and run <strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;">tutor local launch</span> or <span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">tutor k8s launch</span></strong>, depending on your deployment method. Tutor will try to automatically upgrade software, run migrations, and run any custom management commands required by the release. For things that cannot be automated, it prints instructions on how to do it manually.</p>
<p>However, occasionally Tutor introduces breaking changes that require manually adjusting your settings or plugin code, so it is important to always read the Tutor release notes, <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/community/release_notes/" target="[object Object]">Open edX release notes</a>, and review all changes before doing an upgrade. You should also verify that any Tutor plugins you are using are compatible with both the new Tutor version and the new Open edX release.</p>
<p>Upgrading releases is a delicate procedure, especially for large instances. Before starting the upgrade, make sure to backup all your data. It is also advisable to look through the <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor/tree/master/tutor/commands/upgrade" target="_blank">upgrade procedures in Tutor code</a> to understand exactly what Tutor will do while upgrading the installation to not run into any surprises.</p>
<p>Many larger instances keep development and/or staging versions of their instance to provide a space to test the impacts of new code. The upgrade process constitutes a perfect use case for this practice, allowing a full test of the impact of the upgrade on your specific configurations.</p>
