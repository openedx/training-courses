<h3><strong>Django App Plugins </strong></h3>
<p>The Open edX platform is built on the Django web framework. We have extended the concept of the Django app to provide improved support plugins. A plugin app can be <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/" target="_blank">pip-installed</a> on a system, making it seem like the plugin is part of the installed system - it appears in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-INSTALLED_APPS" target="_blank">INSTALLED_APPS</a> list, and the plugin’s URLs &amp; Settings are automatically recognized.</p>
<p>More about Plugins can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-django-utils/blob/master/edx_django_utils/plugins/README.rst#plugin-apps" target="[object Object]">Django App Plugins README</a>.</p>
