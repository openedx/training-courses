<p><a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/index.html" target="[object Object]">Tutor</a> allows a developer to install any Open edX stable release, from Koa to the latest version (we encourage always using the latest version). It can also be used for development on top of the master branches, by using Tutor nightly. Therefore, when setting up an Open edX environment for the first time, you need to decide whether to use an existing release or the nightly branches of the Open edX project, this decision will determine the Tutor version to install to provision the Open edX services.</p>
<p>To help you decide, consider that existing releases are meant to be stable and production-ready, but they may not have the latest features. Conversely, while master has the latest changes, it may be unstable and contain bugs. Also, which option to use depends on your specific needs and goals. Here are a few use cases for each of them:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>We want to use master when we are:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Contributing a new feature to the project</li>
<li>Contributing a bug fix or improvement</li>
<li>Testing out the latest features locally</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>We want to use an existing stable release when we are:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Backporting bug fixes to the latest stable releases</li>
<li>Developing new features, improvements or bug fixes for your initiatives</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: As of December 2024, Tutor branches have been renamed from "nightly" and "master" to "main" and "release". <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/t/tutor-branches-rename/14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See this forum post for more details.</a></strong><a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/t/tutor-branches-rename/14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> </a><a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/t/tutor-branches-rename/14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>The following videos in this course were produced prior to December 2024, and may use outdated names for branches.</p>
