<h3><strong>Welcome to Module 2: Developer Setup</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In this module, you’ll learn about our main development environment. By the end of this module, you will have a working local environment setup with one or both of the environments.</p>
<p><strong>What’s a developer environment?</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="https://umbraco.com/knowledge-base/development-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umbraco</a>: A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment… by using a development environment for your website, you'll have a place to make all of the changes you want, without the users of your website noticing.</p>
<p>We present two development environments: <strong><em>Tutor</em></strong> and <em><strong>Devstack</strong></em>. <strong>Tutor</strong> is the recommended development environment for backend development and for running and operating a site (more on this in <a href="/jump_to_id/607e54c8720d4611b686858fe0cf6151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Module 3</a>). <strong>Devstack</strong> is used by people developing Micro Front-ends (MFEs).</p>
