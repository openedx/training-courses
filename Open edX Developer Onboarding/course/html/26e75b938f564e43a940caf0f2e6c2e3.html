<h3><strong>Working with our Product Roadmap </strong></h3>
<p>Before you begin dreaming up ways to make the Open edX platform even better (a mission we all enthusiastically endorse), we recommend that you review the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Product Roadmap</strong></a> to understand the features that are already being developed by either Axim (the Open edX.org parent organization), 2U (our sister project at edx.org), or the community as a whole. The Product Roadmap, implemented in GitHub Projects, captures active areas of investment in the Open edX platform. This board captures everything from current discovery work, known technical debt, standards adoption efforts, teaching and learning advancements, etc. Anything of substantial enough scope should be captured here for the purpose of transparency and coordination. This board does not specify how this work will be completed. Work will be driven by all members of the community. This is a proposal, not a promise.  <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzWVF56YrRKCnJjWSLPMMS_jxiCBENx69F5klm8yVys/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working definitions for board metadata fields can be found here.</a></strong></p>
<p>After reviewing the Product Roadmap, if you have new items that you would like to add - feature requests, proposals for new functionality your team wants to add, and in-flight projects you or your team are working on - please submit a Product Request ticket on GitHub. The resulting product review will ensure your feature makes it on the roadmap and is implemented in a way that meets the project standards, thus making final code review and merging fast. Simply submitting a new feature or fix to the project without having conversations about its look/feel/implementation can double the amount of development time for your team than if they had approached the project for approval before implementation. Product review also allows the project to identify duplicate or conflicting projects. You should read the <strong><a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3875962884/How+to+submit+an+open+source+contribution+for+Product+Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full instructions for submitting a Product Request</a>,</strong> but we summarize them below.</p>
