<p>Now that you have your Open edX instance up and running, you may want to make it look a little more like your organization’s branding. The Open edX system accomplishes this through theming. When theming an Open edX installation, you usually need to implement two distinct theming solutions:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/themes/README.rst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A “comprehensive theme”</a> </strong>for parts of the system that are implemented as Django views</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openedx/brand-openedx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>A branding npm package</strong></a> for parts of the system implemented as MFEs.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Tutor supports both theming engines. To install a custom comprehensive theme, you need to make the source available to Tutor, and then install the theme with the Tutor settheme command as explained in the <a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/tutorials/theming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor documentation</a>.</p>
<p>To install a custom MFE branding package, you can utilize the patches provided by the Tutor-mfe plugin. See <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe#customising-mfes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Note: As of May 2024, a project has kicked off to utilize Design Tokens throughout our front end. This may change how theming works; please consult Tutor documentation and the Open edX forums for the most up-to-date information.</p>
