<h3><strong>XBlocks </strong></h3>
<p>Our legacy extension point, XBlock, is the Open edX component architecture for building courseware. Open edX courseware is built out of components that are combined hierarchically. These include components like the video player, <a href="http://www.lon-capa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LON-CAPA</a> problems, as well as compound components like learning sequences. The API for these components is called XBlocks.</p>
<p>How does this differ from existing industry standards like <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learning Tools Interoperability</a> (LTI) and <a href="http://scorm.com/scorm-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCORM</a>? On a high level, XBlocks are a Python language-level API, and they provides sensible defaults for things like storing data. The core reasons to write an XBlock is that you can develop it outside of the core edx-platform code, development tends to be much faster than developing code within the core platform, and it can be deployed separately from other core code. Like LTI and SCORM tools, authors of XBlocks can choose to share their tool with others.</p>
<p>LTI tools differ from XBlock in a key way. Whereas XBlocks are simply installed on your Open edX server, LTI tools require more infrastructure. The LTI server needs to be run by your Open edX instance operator or another entity in addition to running the LMS. LTI provides more freedom for what you can do within the component but at the cost of more complex infrastructure and operational requirements.</p>
