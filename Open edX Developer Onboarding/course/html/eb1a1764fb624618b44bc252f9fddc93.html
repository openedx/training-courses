<p>Another clever command provides a fun and easy way to add all the files that you have made changes to using:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">$ git add .</span></strong></div>
<p>This <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;"> .  </span></strong>expands to the current directory so all the files that are created and modified are added to the staging area. But there are situations where you want to add a part of the changes or review the changes before adding them, which is generally a good practice. For that, we use:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">$ git add -p .</span></strong></div>
<p>This helps by giving a chunk of changes and waiting for user input where we can split them further, accept the change, or reject them from getting staged. Note: This does not show you new files.</p>
