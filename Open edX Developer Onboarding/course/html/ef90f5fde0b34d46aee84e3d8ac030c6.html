<h3><strong>Accessibility (a11y) </strong></h3>
<p>Coding with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessibility</a> (or “a11y”: “a” + 11 letters + “y”) in mind means ensuring that the features you build can be used by people accessing the site in various ways, for example via use of assistive technology like screen readers. Accessibility primarily impacts how we build frontend features, although that is not always the case.</p>
<p>Some resources we have around a11y:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openedx/paragon/?tab=readme-ov-file#purpose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paragon pattern library</a> defines various elements (such as buttons and text boxes) that we use throughout the frontend; these elements are guaranteed to have a11y built right in. When designing for the frontend, if you use paragon components you're less likely to run into a11y issues than if you roll your own. If you have questions, we recommend you get in touch with the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3707371565/Active+Working+Groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontend Working Group</a>.</p>
