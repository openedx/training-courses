<h3><strong>What is a rebase? </strong></h3>

<p>To understand this, we need to understand a bit about how <strong>Git</strong> works. A <strong>Git repository</strong> is a tree structure, where the nodes of the tree are commits. The diagram above shows an example of a very simple repository: it has four commits on the master branch, and each commit has an ID (in this case, a, b, c, and d). You'll notice that d is currently the latest commit (or <em>HEAD</em>) of the "<em>master"</em> branch.</p>

<p>This diagram shows two branches: "<em>master</em>" and "<em>my-branch</em>". You can see that master and my-branch both contain commits a and b, but then they start to diverge: master contains c and d, while my-branch contains e and f. b is said to be the "<em>merge base</em>" of my-branch in comparison to master -- or more commonly, just the "<em>base</em>". It makes sense: you can see that my-branch was based on a previous version of master.</p>
<p>Since my-branch has gone stale, you will want to bring it up to date with the latest version of master. To put it another way, my-branch needs to contain c and d. You could do a merge, but that causes the branch to contain weird merge commits that make reviewing the pull request much more difficult. Instead, you can do a <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing" target="_blank">rebase</a>.</p>

<p>When you rebase, Git finds the <em>base</em> of your branch (in this case, b), finds all the commits between that base and HEAD (in this case, e and f), and re-plays those commits on the HEAD of the branch you're rebasing onto (in this case, master). Git actually creates new commits that represent what your changes look like on top of master: in the diagram, these commits are called e′ and f′. Git doesn't erase your previous commits: e and f are left untouched, and if something goes wrong with the rebase, you can go right back to the way things used to be via "<em>git rebase --abort</em>".</p>
<p>Another thing to notice is that to Git, a branch is simply a label. The master branch is whatever commit the master label is pointing to, as well as all of that commit's parents. When you rebase a branch, Git moves the branch label to point at the newly-created commits: my-branch is no longer pointing at f, it's now pointing at f′. Going back to the way things used to be just consists of changing that branch label so that it points back at f.</p>
