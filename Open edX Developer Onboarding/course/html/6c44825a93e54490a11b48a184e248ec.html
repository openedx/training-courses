<p>“There are guides for git, but I can’t really recommend any in particular. Git is one of those technologies that you struggle with until one day it ‘clicks’ and you’re using it pretty much without issue. I don’t know a way to shortcut that process, but I haven’t been reading materials on it since it clicked for me, since I didn’t need them anymore.”</p>
