<h3><strong>MFE Toggles </strong></h3>
<p>Each MFE expects configuration that is independent from <span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">edx-platform.</span></strong></span> Right now, the easiest way to check what a particular MFE exposes is to go into each repository and look for a <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">.env </span></strong></span>file. It will contain a list of environment variables that take strings as options. For example, see the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learning/blob/master/.env" target="_blank">Learning MFE's .env file</a>, which contains variables that can be specified in your site, such as <span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">LOGIN_URL.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"></span></strong></span> However, these files tend to be very sparsely commented. You can search the code in the repo for each variable to try and understand what they do, but in some cases, developers have done the right thing and documented them in the repository <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">READMEs</span></strong>. The <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-course-authoring/?tab=readme-ov-file#feature-importexport-pages" target="_blank">Course Authoring MFE README</a> has some good examples; unfortunately, though, that is not the case for all repositories.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, some of these variables are actually used by sub-components, so searching the repository won't find what they're for. A good example of these would be the ones that <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-component-header?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables" target="_blank">frontend-component-header takes</a> (<span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">LOGO_URL</span></strong></span>, <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">SITE_NAME</span></strong></span>, etc).</p>
<p>As for the mechanism to actually set these, Tutor uses something called the mfe_config API, an <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">edx-platform</span></strong></span> feature that lets operators set MFE environment variables (the ones described above) without having to edit the .<span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">env</span> </strong></span>files directly and rebuild the MFE Docker image. This is documented in <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/lms/djangoapps/mfe_config_api/docs/decisions/0001-mfe-config-api.rst#decision" target="_blank">the corresponding ADR</a>, but perhaps the best way to use it in practice is to follow what <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe?tab=readme-ov-file#customising-mfes" target="_blank">tutor-mfe suggests in its documentation.</a> This is helpful for both site operators as well as developers looking to customize their local installation.</p>
