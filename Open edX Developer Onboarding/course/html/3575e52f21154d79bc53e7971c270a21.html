<p>Numerous times throughout this course, we have referred you to the Open edX documentation to learn more about a particular function. The Open edX project follows a documentation system called <a href="http://diataxis.fr/" target="_blank">Diátaxis</a>. Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. If you visit the <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/index.html" target="_blank">Developers home page</a> on docs.openedx.org, you’ll see what we call these: Quickstarts, How-Tos, References, and Concepts. When writing documentation, you should consider what type of documentation you’re trying to write. Are you getting someone up and running with a system or feature? Try a Quickstart. Are you providing a guide to every available API endpoint? That’s a Reference. How-Tos provide a guide to how to perform a task (e.g., how to maintain a repo) while Concepts explain topics at a higher level (e.g., Backend Architecture).</p>
<p>We write documentation in straightforward, technical English (much like the language in this course). We explain acronyms and are otherwise mindful of the fact that English is not the first language of our whole community (avoid idioms and pop-culture references).</p>
<p>Our documentation is far from complete, and we need your help in making it better! If you see something wrong or missing from our docs, please issue a PR to fix them, even if you’re not certain if you’ve got all the details right. We’ll respond quickly and get your stuff merged as fast as we can!</p>
<p>Our documentation pages are written in ReStructured Text or RST. If you’re not familiar with it, you can review <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/references/quick_reference_rst.html" target="_blank">our reference doc</a> to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax.</p>
