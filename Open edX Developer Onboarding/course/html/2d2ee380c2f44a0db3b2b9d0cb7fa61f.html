<h4><strong>Commit History</strong></h4>
<p>Now, let's say you want to look back at previous commits or compare changes. You can use the following command to see the commit history:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">$ git log</span></strong></div>
<p style="font-size: 16px;"></p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The <span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">git log</span> command shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order, allowing you to review the changes made over time. Notice the prefixes (such as "docs:", "build:", or "feat:") on each commit message; these are calledÂ <em>conventional commits</em>, and we will discuss them later in the course. Their purpose is to ensure all commit messages are descriptive.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">That's it for the basic Git commands. Remember, this is just the beginning of your Git journey. There are many more commands and concepts to explore. Practice regularly to become comfortable with Git and version control.</p>
