<h4><strong>API Consistency </strong></h4>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do developers pay attention to what's going on in the APIs for different components to make sure divergences aren't happening? In the front end, Paragon (next section) is a tool to have a consistent UI/UX/accessibility experience across the board. Does that attempt to reach into the backend developer experience?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Currently there are multiple endpoints that do the same things and lots of inconsistency in our APIs because we haven’t had a lead developer or team managing all of our APIs. There are things we can do - for example education and better docs - to improve consistency of our APIs. We encourage you to help out where possible by providing better documentation when you encounter areas that are lacking it. We are also moving to more active monitoring of our API boundaries.</p>
<h4><strong>Future API State </strong></h4>
<p>We want to promote 3rd parties to be able to use system APIs. Hypothetically, they’d use the same internal APIs that we already have and that our system uses. That’s a capability we want to enable in the future. For example, as of 2023 a community team is creating Studio APIs that will allow anyone to create courses using them. This is very exciting because it unlocks the potential for others to build their own authoring frontend, expanding the extensibility and customizability of the Open edX platform.</p>
