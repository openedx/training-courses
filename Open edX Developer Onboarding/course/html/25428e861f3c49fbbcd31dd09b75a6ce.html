<h3><strong>Welcome to Module 3: Site Operators </strong></h3>
<p>This module focuses on people who are interested in running their own Open edX site. The Open edX community often calls these people “site operators” or “DevOps engineers”. This module is optional; if you are a developer but won’t actually be maintaining your own site, you can move on to <a href="/jump_to_id/3f64ab54cba14c199eebe23eeaf90d3d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Module 4</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, you should be able to recognize what it means to deploy an Open edX instance, demonstrate the basic steps to deploy an Open edX site, and identify where to look for additional help.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this course often uses “Open edX instance” and “Open edX site” interchangeably, but in DevOps terms there is a difference. An "instance" refers to a single installation of the Open edX software. A single Open edX instance can be configured to run multiple Open edX "sites" (see <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/configuration/sites/index.html" target="[object Object]">Configuring Open edX Sites</a>). Two sites can appear to be completely separate to the end user (using different domains and styling) while being powered by the same instance on the backend. One common use for this functionality is to provide a version of your content in a different language, another might be to allow targeted programs within your organization to feature their specific programming.</p>
