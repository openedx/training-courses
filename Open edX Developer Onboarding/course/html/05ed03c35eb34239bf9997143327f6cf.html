<p>In summary, please follow these steps when opening a PR:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li><strong>Use a draft PR:</strong> Start with your PR in “draft” mode until you’re ready for review.</li>
<li><strong>Flesh Out the Summary:</strong> Be sure your PR has a detailed summary: why is your PR needed, links to previous feature requests or bug reports, steps for bug reproduction and/or steps to try out your new feature, screenshots and videos. Follow the PR template, if the repo has one.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Tests Pass:</strong> Right before you submit, make sure all the tests pass locally on your PR. Before taking your PR out of draft, ensure all the CI checks are green. Follow the steps in the CI/CD Tools unit for help.</li>
<li><strong>Rebase While Waiting:</strong> Rebase atop master frequently while you wait so your PR doesn’t get stale.</li>
<li><strong>Accept Feedback:</strong> PRs rarely get merged exactly as they are submitted. When you get feedback, don’t be defensive - but please ask follow up questions when you don’t understand something.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate Delays:</strong> Let us know if it’s going to be awhile before you can respond to feedback.</li>
