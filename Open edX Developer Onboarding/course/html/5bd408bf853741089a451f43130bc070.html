<p>As mentioned in the last unit, MFEs interact with <strong>edx-platform</strong> through APIs. MFEs don’t have a database; all the data is supplied to MFEs through the APIs. These APIs are used to read, write, update, and delete data in <strong>edx-platform</strong>. MFEs don’t have their own open APIs - you cannot make an API call to an MFE. MFE APIs are triggered by user interaction (either the learner, instructor or superuser).</p>
<p>If you are interested in working with MFEs, you will want to familiarize yourself with <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform/en/latest/references/lms_apis.html" target="_blank">the documentation for the LMS APIs</a> . Other Django services may have additional APIs, which you can view on your local machine. Most Django services have a live API view which you can reach by running the service locally and going to its url <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">+ /api-docs</span></strong> as shown here:</p>
<p><img height="100%" width="100%" src="/static/api-docs.png" alt="Screenshot of Open edX API version 1 documentation within Swagger interface, featuring a list of API categories and endpoints with descriptions for operations like GET and POST." /></p>
<p>You should also review <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AC/pages/18350757/Open+edX+REST+API+Conventions" target="_blank">this reference for API best practices</a>.</p>
<p>A frontend API (an “external” API) is designed to assume that the user upon whom the action is being taken is the user who is making the request. For example, the <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform/en/latest/references/lms_apis.html#post--user-v1-accounts-name_change-" target="_blank">name_change endpoint</a> is a <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">POST</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">/api/user/v1/accounts/name_change/ </span></strong>and will change the profile name of the user making the call.</p>
<p>However, an API made for internal systems (such as this <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/projects/edx-platform/en/latest/references/lms_apis.html#post--user-v1-accounts-name_change-username-confirm-" target="_blank">second name_change endpoint</a>, <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">POST /api/user/v1/account/name_change/{username}/confirm</span>)</strong> will ask for the requester to supply username or user id of the user to update. Any superuser can make this change.</p>
<p>How do you know if an API is designed for external or internal usage? Someone may have documented that intention in the API’s docstring (which you can see in the generated API docs), but in many cases we haven’t done this well, so you’ll need to inspect code. Unfortunately, it can be hard to glean intention automatically from the name or structure of the API. Searching and/or posting to the forums can be helpful if you get stuck.</p>
<p>An example of how APIs interact can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/brian-smith-tcril/frontend-app-workshop-example/blob/simple-api/src/example/data/coursesApiService.js" target="_blank">courseApiService.js</a>. Here an API call is made to <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">&lt;LMS_BASE_URL&gt;/api/courses/v1/courses/</span></strong> in <span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong>courseApiService.js</strong> </span>which will get a list of courses from <strong>edx-platform</strong> to the MFE.</p>
<p>A more functional example can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-course-authoring/blob/master/src/data/services/StudioApiService.js" target="_blank">StudioApiService.js</a>. This demonstrates the use of LMS/Studio APIs in MFEs. In <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-course-authoring/blob/master/src/data/services/StudioApiService.js" target="_blank">StudioApiService.js</a> API call is made to <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">STUDIO_BASE_URL/api/contentstore/v1/proctored_exam_settings/&lt;courseID&gt;</span></strong><courseid>. It will get a proctored exam setting for a course with course_id. This information is supplied to the MFE. </courseid></p>
