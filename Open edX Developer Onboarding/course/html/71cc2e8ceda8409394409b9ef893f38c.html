<p>One of the strengths of an open source codebase lies in the vast investment of human resources in reviewing and testing the codebase. With so many “eyes” on the system, problems can be quickly identified and addressed. Following a few simple protocols ensures the safety and security of the software in all of its instances.</p>
<p>If you find a security issue (something that compromises the integrity of Open edX instances or the personal data of Open edX users), please do not report it publicly. Write a report with as much information as you can, and email it to <a href="mailto:security@openedx.org" target="_blank">security@openedx.org</a>. See our <a href="https://github.com/openedx/axim-engineering/security/policy" target="_blank">project security policy</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>If you find a bug, you should first write up a bug report in the repo closest to the bug. A good bug report effectively communicates the steps to reproduce the bug and the expected behavior that should have occurred. If you’re not sure where to report a bug, you can ask advice in the forums or Slack, or report it in the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/public-engineering/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">public-engineering project.</a></p>
<p>This <a href="https://marker.io/blog/how-to-write-bug-report" target="_blank">article from Marker.io</a> gives more in-depth tips about writing good bug reports.</p>
<p><strong><em>When a security issue is found, a post will be made in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/announcements/security/19" target="_blank">Security Announcements section of the forums</a> around 48 hours before the fix is released. When a fix is released, it can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/security/advisories?state=published" target="_blank">Security Advisories section</a> of the openedx GitHub organization.</em></strong></p>
