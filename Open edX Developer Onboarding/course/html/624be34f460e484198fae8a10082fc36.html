<p>The Open edX community has been working to make the core Open edX codebase more lean and efficient. Most of that work has entailed moving discrete packages of functionality (such as the Learner Dashboard) into separate code bases called Micro Front Ends. You should only install the MFEs that your instance will actually use, which will make your maintenance and routine upgrade process run more swiftly and efficiently and reduce the load on your server.</p>
<p>Tutor delegates handling of MFEs to the <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor-mfe plugin</a>. The plugin installs several MFEs by default such as discussions and grade book (<a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See the full list of MFEs installed by default)</a>. In addition to the built-in default MFEs, the Tutor MFE plugin also handles deploying custom MFE apps. Custom MFEs allow you to expand the functionality of your Open edX instance and provide the bespoke features that will most benefit your users. It is one of the signature benefits to running an Open edX system as your LMS.</p>
<p>To deploy a custom MFE app, you need to create a Tutor plugin and use filters provided by the Tutor-mfe plugin to inject configuration for your custom MFE. Please refer to theÂ <a href="https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe#adding-new-mfes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor-mfe plugin docs</a> for details.</p>
