<p>Confluence is a wiki-style site where the community publishes pages related to current and past projects, programs like the Core Contributor and Maintainer programs, information on upcoming events, and more. You can browse the wiki at <strong><a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/overview?mode=global" target="_blank">openedx.atlassian.net</a>,</strong> where you can browse all the pages with no account. We encourage you to make an account, which allows you to comment on pages, update older pages to have more current information, and even create new resource pages.</p>
