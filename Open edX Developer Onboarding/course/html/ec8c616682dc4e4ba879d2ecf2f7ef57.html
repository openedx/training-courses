<p>The Open edX project spans 200+ repositories and is worked on by multiple developers. The following resources help you understand the process of getting your pull request reviewed and how you’ll interact with PR Project Managers. It may take some time to have your pull request reviewed. While you’re waiting for review, it’s a good idea to rebase your PR every week or so to keep it from getting stale.</p>
<p>One key to a fast PR is its length and how many changes it makes: a short PR that makes one change is likely to receive review faster than a long PR that implements multiple changes. A PR that implements a change described by a approved Product Proposal will be reviewed ahead of one that arrives unexpectedly. Additionally, review happens faster on our smaller repositories (and longest on edx-platform).</p>
<p>If you have submitted a PR and it feels like it has been a long time, please understand that it just can take a long time for some PRs to get attention, particularly ones that are lengthy or in very large repos. Before you do anything else, review the <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/references/developer_guide/process/FAQ-about-pull-requests.html" target="_blank">FAQs on the Open edX site.</a> Then, consider pinging the Community PR Manager for an update.</p>
