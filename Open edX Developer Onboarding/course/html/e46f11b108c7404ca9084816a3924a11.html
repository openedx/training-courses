<h3><strong>Tutor Users Group Charter </strong></h3>
<p>We aim to improve the experience for developers working on the Open edX platform by:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Identifying what qualities make a developer experience “good” (low on-boarding overhead, easy testing, etc.), with understanding that needs will vary between different members of the community</li>
<li>Identifying the gaps between our current developer experiences and the desired state</li>
<li>Actively improving our current developer processes and tools</li>
<li>Empowering the community to build and maintain tooling extensions that suit their needs</li>
<li>Where possible, aligning different groups of developers on shared development solutions</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The Working Group will serve as a space for folks who are collaborating on developer experience projects to seek help, share knowledge, discuss ideas, and align their work with one another. We are likely to focus both on high-level questions (ex. “What would the ideal developer experience be?”) and concrete improvements (ex. “What will we do this month to make Tutor/ easier to use?”).</p>
