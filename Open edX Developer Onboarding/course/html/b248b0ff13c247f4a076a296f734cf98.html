<h4><strong>Learning Management System (LMS) </strong></h4>
<p>The LMS is the most visible part of the Open edX platform. Learners take courses using the LMS. The LMS also provides an instructor dashboard that users who have the Admin or Staff role can access by selecting Instructor.</p>
<p>The LMS uses a number of data stores. Courses are stored in MongoDB, with videos served from YouTube or Amazon S3. Per-learner data is stored in MySQL. As learners move through courses and interact with them, events are published to the analytics pipeline for collection, analysis, and reporting.</p>
<h4><strong>Studio </strong></h4>
<p>Studio is the course authoring environment. Course teams use it to create and update courses. Studio writes its courses to the same Mongo database that the LMS uses.</p>
