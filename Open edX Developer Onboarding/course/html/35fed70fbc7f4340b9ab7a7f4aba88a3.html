<p>The previous module explained how to use Tutor for Open edX development. In addition to being the Open edX community-supported development environment, Tutor is also the community-supported distribution for deploying Open edX code to production environments.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with Tutor for production deployments is to use <a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/local.html" target="_blank">Tutor’s “local” deployment</a>, which installs and runs all required components on a single server or virtual machine. It uses <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/" target="_blank">docker-compose</a> to orchestrate the docker images and stores all data locally. The process is very similar to the Tutor local deployment described in Module 2, with adjustments made to optimize the hosting of live sites.</p>
<p>This method can be sufficient for simple installations with a low number of users. However, please note that there will still be a moderate number of resources used - the platform’s base requirements require installation of many different things.</p>
