<h4><strong>How to handle feedback on your PR </strong></h4>
<p>Once your PR is submitted, you’ll receive feedback from product managers, UI/UX designers, and/or coders about your feature/fix. The feedback may feel like a lot of work or difficult to do. How should you handle this?</p>
<p><strong>First</strong> off, be upfront about your time limitations. If you’re not going to have time, or time for a while, to address feedback please leave a comment and say so. We’ll do the same for you! Open source projects work like that sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, be honest about what you do and don’t know. If you receive feedback to add or change something, but you don’t know how to do it, just ask! You can directly ask as a comment on the pull request. As mentioned before, our community prides itself on being friendly and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Finally,</strong> be thorough, thoughtful, and polite in your responses. Many times reviewers of the code don’t remember all its little details like you might, since you’ve just been working in that area. For example, this code deleted a test, and the reviewer wanted to know why the test wasn’t fixed instead:</p>

<p>Collegial collaboration is the key to a successful open source codebase!</p>
