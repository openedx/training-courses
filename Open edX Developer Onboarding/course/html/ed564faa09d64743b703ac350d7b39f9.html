<p><strong>Tutor</strong> is a community-supported Docker-based Open edX distribution both for production and local development. The goal of Tutor is to make it easy to deploy, customize, upgrade and scale an Open edX installation. Tutor is reliable, fast, extensible, and it is already being used to deploy hundreds of Open edX platforms around the world.</p>
