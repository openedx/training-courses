<h3><strong>Who is this module for? </strong></h3>
<p>This module is aimed at developers new to open-source software development in general and new to the Open edX community, specifically. It covers the basics of interacting with the Open edX project’s developers, project managers, and product managers; how to make bug reports and feature requests; and how to submit code from your fork “upstream” to the Open edX GitHub project.</p>
<p>The latter part of this module covers material even experienced developers will benefit from: the Open edX project’s CI/CD tools and what to expect after you open a pull request on one of the project’s repos.</p>
