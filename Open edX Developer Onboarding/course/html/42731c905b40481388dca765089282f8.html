<h4><strong>Accessibility</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to the above generic coding guidelines, the Open edX project strives to maintain <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" target="_blank">WCAG 2.2 compliance</a> in all platform components. The World Wide Web Consortium describes WCAG 2.2 as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general. </em></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that the term Accessibility is often abbreviated to “a11y” - “a” followed by the number 11 (signifying the 11 letters in the middle of the word) followed by “y”. You’ll see this abbreviation a lot.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with coding for accessibility standards, Module 6 has a variety of resources on the topic.</p>
