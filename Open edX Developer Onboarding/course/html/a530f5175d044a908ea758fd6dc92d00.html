<h3><strong>Welcome to the Open edX Project's Developer Onboarding Course! </strong></h3>
<p>This course is for developers who already have experience writing code and will learn how to apply that knowledge to the Open edX project. Also, site operators with a familiarity of the command line will learn how to deploy and run their own Open edX instance.</p>
<p>This course assumes you have familiarity with some of the basics of coding - knowledge of at least one programming language will be very helpful as you go through this course. We provide links to some recommended resources for getting up to speed with our tech stack (Python/Django, JavaScript/React) in the <a href="/jump_to_id/c5cc10f4b4e64bd0b3d52720d5ec38a4">last module of this course</a>.</p>
<p>After taking this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Identify the technical architecture of the Open edX platform</li>
<li>Create and run a development environment</li>
<li>Determine the steps to deploy and run your own Open edX instance</li>
<li>Recognize how we do development on the Open edX project</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to contribute your code back to the main project.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like more context on the Open edX project - including project history, project context, and an overview of the different roles for Core Contributors (not just via code!) - we recommend you start with <a href="https://training.openedx.io/courses/course-v1:OpenedX+OEX101+2023/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intro to the Open edX Project &amp; Contributing</a>. This course assumes that you know the content covered in the Intro to the Open edX Project course.</p>
