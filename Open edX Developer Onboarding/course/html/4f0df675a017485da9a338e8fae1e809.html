<h3><strong>Platform Basics </strong></h3>
<p>The Open edX platform is a web-based platform for creating, delivering, and analyzing online courses. It is the software that powers edx.org and many other online education sites.</p>
<p>There are a handful of major components in the Open edX platform. Where possible, these communicate using stable, documented APIs. The centerpiece of the Open edX architecture is <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">edx-platform</a>, which contains the learning management and course authoring applications (LMS and Studio, respectively).</p>
<p>This service is supported by a collection of other autonomous web services called independently deployed applications (IDAs) and Micro-Frontends (MFEs). Over time, we plan to break out more of the existing edx-platform functions into new IDAs and MFEs. This strategy will help manage the complexity of the edx-platform code base to make it as easy as possible for developers to approach and contribute to the project. Almost all of the server-side code in the Open edX platform is in Python, with Django as the web application framework.</p>
