<h3><strong>Welcome to Module 4: Writing Code for The Project</strong></h3>
<p>So far, this course has introduced you to the Open edX platform and community, provided a technical overview of the Open edX project as a whole, walked through setting up a local development Open edX environment on your computer and discussed the approaches and technical requirements for setting up an Open edX instance. Now, it’s time to explore the Open edX codebase.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, you will understand the project’s development best practices (including version control, testing, and documentation standards). You will be prepared to start writing your own code for the Open edX project.</p>
