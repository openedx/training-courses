<h3><strong>Architectural &amp; Foundational Documentation </strong></h3>
<p>The Open edX project prides itself on architectural quality and consensus on decisions (architectural and more). In order to maintain this high quality, we have a series of decision documents that we use to propose changes to code/coding processes, and come to agreement on them. These documents are written in Git repositories and debated on GitHub pull requests. They are open and public to read. There are two types of documents:</p>
<ul>
<ul><ol>
<li><strong>Open edX Proposals, or OEPs (oh-epps)</strong>. An OEP is a document that details a specific technology or community decision being made by the Open edX community, in the form of a best practice, architecture design, or process adjustment. These documents describe large changes/big pieces of architecture. You can read OEPs on the <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Open edX Proposals site</a> and on <a href="https://github.com/openedx/open-edx-proposals" target="[object Object]">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Architectural Decision Records, or ADRs, are smaller documents.</strong> They are local lightweight documents of technical decisions co-located with their corresponding code - that is, you will find ADRs scattered throughout all Open edX repositories, describing changes those apps have made. They provide rationale behind the code and the archeological path to their current state.</li>
</ol></ul>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about what OEPs and ADRs are, and how they’re used, in <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0019-bp-developer-documentation.html" target="_blank">OEP-19</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a third type of documentation, a <strong>DEPR (deprecation) ticket</strong>, that project members file when they are looking to deprecate some set of technology. This keeps our codebase free of stale, outdated, and/or unused code. Having this stuff around makes the codebase hard to maintain and hard to develop in. Check out <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0021-proc-deprecation.html" target="_blank">OEP-21</a> for more information on the DEPR process; there’s links in there to see what we’re currently in the middle of deprecating.</p>
