<p>When working in any codebase, you will inevitably have questions about how to write a specific line of code. Open source communities thrive on helping each other solve problems; the question is simply, where should you go with questions while developing? It depends on the type of question that you have.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how a feature should actually work, the design of the feature, or other Product/UX questions, you should engage with the product team on the feature request or roadmap ticket for the feature. There are various <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3449028609/Product+Working+Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Working Group Meetings</a> you can attend and ask questions about things like LTI integrations and UX/UI design. Get in touch with the product team early and often as you are implementing your feature so you can be assured your product will be accepted with minimal revisions when it comes time to submit your code. If you’re not sure which Product group to reach out to, start with the Core Product Working Group - they’ll be able to help you out.</p>
<p>Have questions about the actual <em>implementation</em> of a feature or bugfix? The <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forums</a> are your best place for advice. Before posting, please search the forums - it’s possible your question has already been asked. When posting, be sure to pick a proper category for your questions, so you alert the right people. The “Development” category, and its subcategories, are usually the right ones to choose to ask about development questions. Other useful categories include the “Site Operators” category for questions about running your own Open edX instance (as described in Module 3), or the “Educators” category for questions about how to author a course (including how to use various problem types).</p>
<p>You can also open GitHub Issues in repos you’re working in to file bug reports and engage in conversations with project maintainers (<a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0055-proc-project-maintainers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OEP-55, Project Maintainers</a> defines maintainership). You can find the named maintainers by viewing the “owner” field in the top-level <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">catalog-info.yaml </span></strong>file in each repo (for example, see the one in the open-edx-proposals repo).</p>
