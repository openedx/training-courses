<p>Once you’ve written some code updates in your fork of one of the Open edX repositories you’ve downloaded to your environment, it's time to consider if that code needs to be upstreamed. “Upstream” refers to code that the main project runs - in our case, the Open edX project. Sometimes when you write custom code on your local machine, you are only interested in running that custom code on your own instance. Other times - perhaps when you find and fix a bug in the codebase or want to develop a new feature to share with the whole community - you want everyone in the community to run your custom code on their Open edX instances. In order to do that you have to contribute your code upstream.</p>
<p>In this case, where you are an Open edX contributor, you will not be able to make changes directly to any of the Open edX repos. Instead, you will have to create a personal fork. Personal forks are a standard open source approach to making pull requests against repos where you don’t have write access.</p>
