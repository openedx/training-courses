<p>An open-source project is only as strong as its community; a project with a community that is hostile, negative, or unwelcoming to newcomers is a project that is self-limiting its growth and the number of people willing to contribute. We want the Open edX platform to be the most popular online educational platform for people all over the world, and the only way we’ll achieve that lofty goal is by growing the community of developers (and product managers, and translators, and more) who support the project. Where do you fit in to all of this?</p>
<p>When communicating with people in the community, keep your communications friendly - use a few extra words or emoji to convey your message and keep the mood light. Pause to consider another person’s motivation before replying to them, and don’t reply right away if you’re feeling annoyed or angry at them. Consider the effect your words have on another person. Hearing “No, that won’t work” is an answer that doesn’t feel good. Hearing “We’ve tried that, and it didn’t work like we thought it would, and here’s some documentation that explains why” is a more complete answer that doesn’t shut the person down.</p>
<p>When writing on the forums, first search the forums to see if your question has already been answered. When posting, respect others - even if they disagree with you. You can engage in constructive conversation with someone who disagrees with you. Don’t resort to insults or put-downs. Pause and re-read your post before clicking submit. If you are encountering bad behavior on the forums, reach out to the Open edX conduct committee at <a href="mailto:conductcommittee@openedx.org" target="_blank">conduct_committee@openedx.org</a>.</p>
