<h3><strong>An open-source project</strong></h3>
<p>A note on what we mean when we talk about the Open edX project being “<strong>open-source</strong>”. The Open edX platform was founded on the fundamental principle of providing an accessible education to learners of all backgrounds. The founders intended to meet instructional design needs by creating engaging experiences that cover different topics, pursue different goals and use different learning scenarios. Two decades later, the goal of accessible education to all learners everywhere continues to drive our work on the Open edX codebase. Accessible means many things, from being literally accessible (WCAG 2.1 compliant) to being online, flexible, and available at any moment of the day. The Open edX project provides massively scalable learning software to educational institutions, enterprises, and government organizations. We are here everyday to improve the software and learning experiences and enhance the experience for the learner.</p>
<p>Many of us who work on the Open edX project are here <em><strong>because</strong> </em>the platform is open-source. The project’s source code is licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">Gnu Affero General Public License (AGPL) version 3</a>.

<p><strong>Open-source software is defined as software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly. By design, open-source software licenses promote collaboration and sharing because they permit other people to make modifications to source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects. They encourage computer programmers to access, view, and modify open-source software whenever they like, as long as they let others do the same when they share their work. - https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source</p>

<p>The open-source philosophy and ethos infuses the Open edX project with a strong sense of collaboration and sharing. We strive to do "development in public", that is, that all contributors to the project are doing as much of their work as possible in a public fashion, using public collaboration tools like GitHub Projects and our Confluence wiki.</p>
