<p>The Open edX Contributor License Agreement (CLA) allows Axim to use and license your code submissions. As a result, Axim is able to add your code to the Open edX platform and share it with the world under an open source license like the AGPL v3 license that we use for the platform.</p>
<p>All contributors need to have their submissions covered by a CLA. If you are submitting your own work and it does not relate to work that your employer is doing, you can use the individual CLA. If you work for a company that works on the Open edX platform, and your contributions relate to work that your company is doing, check with your employer to see if you’re covered by an entity CLA. If your contribution is outside the scope of your company work, the individual CLA may be appropriate. If you're not sure which agreement to use, feel free to ask! We're at <a href="mailto:oscm@axim.org" target="_blank">oscm@axim.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you are an individual contributor, we encourage you to sign your CLA now, before you make your first code submission, so it doesn’t block the processing of your future contributions. Visit <a href="https://openedx.org/cla" target="_blank">https://openedx.org/cla</a> to sign.</p>
