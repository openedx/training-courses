<h3><strong>Backend Services </strong></h3>
<p>Testing provides important quality control on any changes you have made to the codebase, ensuring that everything functions as expected. For backend repositories, most repos use <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile" target="_blank">Makefiles</a> to create commands to run tests. By and large, to run tests you’ll use <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">make test</span></strong> in the repo root directory to execute tests.</p>
<p>In most repos, running <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">make help</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1em;"> from the root of the directory will show you what targets exist. However, the help directive is not implemented in all Makefiles, so inspecting the Makefile may be your only choice. (Note: we’d love a pull request that implements the help directive!) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">If you need to, you can check out the repo’s Makefile (for example, <a href="https://github.com/openedx/xblock-lti-consumer/blob/master/Makefile" target="_blank">xblock-lti-consumer's Makefile</a>) to see what targets exist for running tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">Running tests within the <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">edx-platform</span></strong> repo works a bit differently. Within this repo you don’t use </span><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">make</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1em;"> commands, instead, you drop into a shell and run tests via pytest. See the <a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/dev.html#running-edx-platform-unit-tests" target="_blank">Tutor docs on running edx-platform unit tests</a>.</span></p>
