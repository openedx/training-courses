<p>There are several hosting providers within the Open edX community who were simultaneously building hosting solutions around Tutor and Kubernetes. It became apparent that most of them were running into the same problems and were working on similar solutions, so the Large Instances Working Group was formed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-k8s-harmony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harmony project</a> was born from the realization that many individual providers were converging on similar solutions and the desire to join forces and consolidate the work. It aims to provide a rich set of <a href="https://helm.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helm</a> charts and Tutor plugins for managing shared resources (a load balancer / ingress controller, autoscaling infrastructure, monitoring tools, databases, etc.) and setting up a Kubernetes cluster, incorporating the best-practices from collaborating providers.</p>
<p>The Harmony project is currently being actively developed, though in the future it is expected to be the go-to solution for robust, production-ready Open edX deployments. The development is overseen by the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3655008783/Large+Instances+-+DevOps+Sub-Working+Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Instances - DevOps Working Group</a>. If you want to get involved you are welcome to join the bi-weekly meetings and check out the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/42/views/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project board.</a></p>
