<h3><strong>Documentation </strong></h3>
<p>As you go about documenting the Open edX platform, you’ll be writing in RST (ReStructured Text) and learning how to organize documents in the correct way, according to Diátaxis. At the 2023 Open edX conference, Feanil Patel (Axim) &amp; Sarina Canelake (Axim) gave a tutorial on creating documentation. There were two tracks: one for coders, and one for non-coders. Feel free to pass along this tutorial to the non-coders on your team; we’d love to have them contribute!</p>
