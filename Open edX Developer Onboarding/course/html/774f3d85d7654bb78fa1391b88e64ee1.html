<p>In complex software development projects, like building a Python library, an API, or software development kit, often you will be working with multiple files, multiple packages, and dependencies. As a result, it is wise to isolate your Python development environment for that particular project. As mentioned in Module 1, <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">virtualenv </a>is a tool to create isolated Python environments.</p>
<p>When you activate a virtual environment for your project, your project becomes its own self contained application, independent of the system installed Python and its modules. Your new virtual environment has its own pip to install libraries, its own libraries folder, where new libraries are added, and its own Python interpreter for the Python version you used to activate the environment.</p>
<p>In short, your project’s dependencies are isolated, meaning that if you run other projects (in their own virtual environments!) with different dependencies (or different versions of the same dependencies) they’ll be isolated from each other.</p>
