<p>The Open edX project follows <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0051-bp-conventional-commits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OEP-51, which describes "Conventional Commits"</a>. The basic premise of OEP-51 is that commits should be clearly labeled for their effect on consumers of the repository. To do this, we adopt the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conventional Commits</a> guidelines, which detail structured commit messages that clarify the impact of each commit.</p>
<p>Why do this? Developers should describe the changes they make. This information is valuable to many audiences: other developers, deployers, integrators, end-users, operators, and so on. Developers are in the best position to accurately describe their work and its implications.</p>
<p>The nearer to the change that information is captured, the easier it will be to write, and the more accurate it will be. Changes made by developers are consumed by many people, from the pull request reviewer to the final user of the product. The more the developer can explain the change, the more easily the change will be understood and used, and the more efficient the overall development process will be.</p>
<p>Commit messages are the closest text to the change itself. The more information-rich we can make commit messages, the more useful they will be.</p>
<p>To see which Conventional Commit messages we use, see the <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0051-bp-conventional-commits.html#specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"specification" section of OEP-51</a>.</p>
