<p>The Open edX project started with a monolithic repository called <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform" target="[object Object]">edx-platform</a>, which is still the largest and most actively developed repo in the project. However, we’re gradually moving away from this monolith and we encourage everyone to develop as much as possible in repos that aren’t edx-platform. A few alternative repos include:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>MFEs:</strong> MFEs, or Micro Front-ends, encapsulate frontend functionality for many features that you see when using the Open edX platform. Lightweight and agile, MFEs enable faster development and deployment. The most visible MFE is <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frontend-app-learning</a>, which powers the courseware pages you see (like the one you are reading right now!).</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>There are over twenty MFEs and counting! <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/repositories?q=frontend-&amp;type=all&amp;language=&amp;sort=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Review the current list</a> to get a better sense of which Open edX functionalities are deployed via MFEs.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Paragon:</strong> An accessible, theme-ready design system built for the Open edX project specifically, <a href="https://github.com/openedx/paragon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paragon’s</a> reusable components provide a visually consistent user experience in MFEs. If you intend to code custom MFEs, Paragon will be integral to your work.</li>
<li><strong>XBlocks:</strong> The building blocks of the Open edX courseware, XBlocks power everything that students interact with in the Open edX courseware. You’re currently looking at an HTML XBlock that has been configured to display text. So far in this course, you’ve also encountered an HTML XBlock configured as an iframe, the Video XBlock, the Problem XBlock, and the PDF XBlock. Browse the list of Open edX official XBlocks. Note that many other XBlocks have been and are currently being developed by the community.</li>
