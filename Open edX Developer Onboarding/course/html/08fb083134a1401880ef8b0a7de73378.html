<h3><strong>Other Courseware Extension Points </strong></h3>
<p>In addition to XBlocks, there are a few ways to extend course behavior:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The LMS is an <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/toolsinteroperability2.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LTI tool consumer</a>. Course authors can embed LTI tools to integrate other learning tools into an Open edX course.</li>
<li>Problems can use embedded Python code to either present the problem or assess the learnerâ€™s response. Instructor-written Python code is executed in a secure environment called CodeJail.</li>
<li>JavaScript components can be integrated using JS Input.</li>
<li>Courses can be exported and imported using OLX (open learning XML), an XML- based format for courses.</li>
</ul>
