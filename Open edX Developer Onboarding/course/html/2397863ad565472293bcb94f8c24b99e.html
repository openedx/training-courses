<p>We’ve mentioned upstreaming a number of times throughout this course and provided a quick overview of how it works. This module explores the upstreaming process in greater detail. As a reminder, “upstream contributions” refers to custom code that you write locally for your own project that you then send back to the main project for review and possible addition to the codebase. You won’t upstream every section of code that you write; sometimes you are only interested in running that code on your own site. But when you find and fix a bug or develop a new feature the whole community can use, you contribute your code upstream.</p>
<p>This module discusses how to make a contribution to one of the code repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/openedx" target="[object Object]"><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong>openedx</strong> </span></a>GitHub organization. The contribution process is complex and can take time; each contribution is reviewed by a committee of developers to ensure that its function is clear and there are no unintended consequences or side effects. Then, it must be scheduled for merging into the next named release and added to the documentation. The advantage to this process is that the entire community can be assured that the codebase remains largely free of bugs and is easy to read - both in terms of clarity of code and quality of comments/documentation. By the end of this module, you will be armed with the knowledge you need to make an upstream contribution to the Open edX project (or any open-source project!).</p>
