<p>The Open edX Community uses Slack for real-time communication. This is good for coordinating meetings with working groups (discussed in the next section) or discussing with another community member how to split up a work item. For general questions, though, we encourage you to use Discourse. Slack's history is not as searchable as Discourse's history, and Slack history disappears after 6 months. Asking a question in Discourse will benefit the community more than asking in Slack. Join our slack instance:Â <a href="https://openedx.org/slack" target="_blank">https://openedx.org/slack</a></p>
