<h3><strong>New update to the core platform </strong></h3>
<p>If we don’t have extension points for the kind of change you want to make, you might need to make a change to the core source. This can be complex and we encourage you to reach out to us to talk about the kind of changes you want to make - we’ll cover how to do this in <strong>Modules 4 &amp; 5</strong>.</p>
