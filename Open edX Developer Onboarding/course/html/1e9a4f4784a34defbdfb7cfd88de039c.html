<h3><strong>This is it! The section you’ve been waiting for: Pull Requests! </strong></h3>
<p>If you’re relatively new to the developer world, you might not be familiar with this term. GitHub defines a Pull Request as “a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.” If you haven’t opened a pull request before, check out Module 6: Opening A Pull Request, for more information on how to open a pull request to the upstream project from your fork. You may also want to review the “<a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/references/developer_guide/process/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contributing to the Open edX Project</a>” section of the Open edX documentation site.</p>
<p>When you open a pull request, there are a few things you should do to make the process go as smoothly as possible:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use draft pull requests when opening a pull request that isn’t ready to be reviewed yet.</strong> Sometimes you do this because you want feedback on in-progress work, or to run CI tests (next section). To convert a pull request to a draft, use the “Convert to Draft” button in the right hand sidebar of your PR:</p>

<p><strong>2. When you open your pull request, write a good description!</strong> Many repos in the project have a pull request template, for example, <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the template for edx-platform</a>. We humbly ask that you use the GitHub GUI to open pull requests, read the template for the appropriate repo carefully, and write as much detail as you possibly can. Screenshots and screen capture videos are great, when you can add them.</p>
