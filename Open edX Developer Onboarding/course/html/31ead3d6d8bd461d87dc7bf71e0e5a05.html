<h3><strong>Named Releases </strong></h3>
<p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t discuss Named Releases as part of this course. The Open edX platform is being constantly developed - every day! - but operators want to make sure the version of the platform they run is stable and reliable. The Open edX community can share knowledge and improvements more easily when many people use the same stable, consistent version of the Open edX code. Open edX releases create milestones that are easier to talk about and use than the ever-shifting master branches - although development of new features does take place on top of the master branches.</p>
<p>Thus, the project - lead by the <em>Build-Test-Release (BTR) Working Group</em> - releases a new named release every six months, June and December. These named releases have been tested for two months by BTR members and bug fixes applied until it is stable. Community members then have the opportunity to upgrade to the newest version using Tutor to migrate.</p>
<p>We discussed Working Groups in the <a href="https://training.openedx.org/courses/course-v1:Axim+Open-edX-Intro+2023/about" target="_blank">Intro to Open edX Project &amp; Contributing</a> course, and we’ll discuss more about Tutor in <strong>Modules 2 &amp; 3</strong>.</p>
<p>Named Releases do indeed have names! We name them after trees; our first release was Aspen in September 2014; the Palm release was made in June 2023. The newest releases at time of writing are Redwood (June 2024), Sumac (December 2024), and Teak (June 2025).
