<h3><strong>Python Courses and Tutorials</strong></h3>
<p>Here are some resources for learning Python that our community recommends:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>YouTube</strong> - There are quite a few YouTube tutorials that are great. Some recommendations are:</p>

<li><em>“I think some of his videos on simple things in python are very good. I wish I saw them when I was learning Python.” </em></li>

<ul>
<ul>
<li><em>“James Powell’s talks helped me greatly to understand Python more in depth. The main theme of his talks is breaking down the interfaces Python has, which are useful for."</em></li>

<p><strong>Practice Exercises/Tutorials: </strong>When you’re just starting, doing small coding problems can help a lot to practice understanding of syntax, basic flow control and using built-in functions and libraries.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeWars</a></strong></li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>CodeWars is great (not only for Python, but for any language that is supported there), because most of the problems are more interesting than the usual LeetCode problems, and after you’ve solved a problem, you can see solutions of others, which is incredibly useful for evaluating your own solution and learning different approaches.</li>
<li>Most of the top rated solutions will at the very least heavily use built in libraries, which, especially as a beginner, helps you widen your awareness of what tools are available (I don’t think there is anyone who went through the whole Python documentation to learn all the libraries that come by default with the language).</li>
<li><em><strong>Note:</strong> there will also be many oneliners - you shouldn’t aim to write code like that, especially in the Open edX code base, as they are often unreadable. However, breaking them down and trying to understand all the quirks and tricks that were used to create it is very interesting and will likely teach you a lot about the language. </em></li>

<p><strong>Books </strong></p>

<li><strong><a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> </strong>- community members say:</li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><em>“While we didn’t get all that far into the text, I really liked how the exercises and ‘bottom-up’ approach the text took helped build a solid grasp of the material. For instance, before you learn Python, you learn basic use of the shell.” </em></li>
<li><em>“Although this book might not be for everyone, as it requires discipline and putting in effort, if you do enjoy it, it will teach you some solid principles that don’t only apply to Python, but to programming in general.” </em></li>

<li><em>[Advanced] "I don’t typically use books or courses for coding stuff, but one that I really liked is <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Programming Patterns 1</a>."</em></li>
<li><em>"It’s not directly related to Python or React or Ops, but I think it’s one of the best explanations of programming patterns in general that I’ve seen, and many of the same ways of thinking are widely applicable outside of game dev. One downside: it does assume a significant base level of programming knowledge and the ability to read C++ syntax. Big upside: it’s free.</em></li>
