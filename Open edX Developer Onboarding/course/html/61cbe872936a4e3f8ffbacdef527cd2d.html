<h3><strong>Introduction: Managing Local Development</strong></h3>
<p>In Module 2, we’ll take you through the creation of your first local development environment. For now we’ll quickly mention a few tools that are used in local development:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>We use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank">Python virtual environments (venvs)</a>. A “virtual environment” is a folder structure that gives you everything you need to run a lightweight, yet isolated, Python environment. It is created on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual environment’s “base” Python, and may optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment, so only those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available. This means that you can develop on different branches or on different repositories that have different versions of installed packages.</li>
<li>We also use <a href="https://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/using-a-node-version-manager.html" target="[object Object]">node version management (nvm)</a>. Node Version Manager is a bash script used to manage multiple released Node.js versions. It allows you to perform operations like install, uninstall, switch version, etc. Similar to Python venvs, when running multiple projects/branches/repos that use different versions of Node, nvm allows you to have an execution space for each project with the correct version of Node.</li>
<li>Behind our virtual environments, we utilize <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>. Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.</li>
