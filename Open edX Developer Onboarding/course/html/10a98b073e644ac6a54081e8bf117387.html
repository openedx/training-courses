<p>Tutor, by default, sets up and runs a copy of all services required by an Open edX instance (MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, object storage…).</p>
<p>For fault-tolerant production deployments, it is often preferred to use hosted solutions instead of running them yourself inside k8s. Hosted services usually come with built-in backup schemes and ability to use multiserver or even multi-region deployments for better reliability.</p>

<p>For example, a typical Open edX AWS production deployment will use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RDS</a> for MySQL, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S3</a> for object storage, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElastiCache</a> for Redis and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSearch Service</a> as an equivalent of Elasticsearch, and perhaps a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/partners/mongodb-atlas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mongo Atlas</a> cluster for the MongoDB instance. You can view the architecture of the system in <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/references/developer_guide/architecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Open edX documentation</a>, although be aware that it may not always be up to date. As of May 2024, we are looking into removing both ElasticSearch and MongoDB; the best place to see what pieces of technology are deprecated or about to be deprecated is in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/announcements/deprecation/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deprecation section of the forums</a>.</p>
<p>While you could in theory set all of these services and configure Tutor to use them manually, this is both time-consuming and error-prone, especially if you are hosting multiple instances or want to set up multiple environments (staging, production, etc.) for your instance.</p>
<p>If you are a DevOps engineer, you are probably already familiar with tools that let you automate infrastructure setup and make it reproducible. Popular tools for infrastructure provisioning are <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terraform</a>, <a href="https://opentofu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenTofu</a>, and <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulumi</a>.</p>
<p>If you are managing your own Open edX instance, it is highly recommended to use one of these tools to set up your infrastructure.</p>
