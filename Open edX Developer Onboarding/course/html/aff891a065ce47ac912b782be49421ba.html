<h3><strong>Developer Documentation</strong></h3>
<p>You should bookmark <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs.openedx.org</a>, our main documentation site for developers (and other personas, too). You’ll find a few different types of documentation on this site, <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described in more depth here</a>:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quickstarts:</strong> step-by-step instructions designed to help you learn a new concept or domain.</li>
<li><strong>How-tos</strong>: guides that help you solve a specific problem.</li>
<li><strong>References:</strong> information guides oriented to people who already know how to solve a problem, but need a refresher.</li>
<li><strong>Explanation/Concepts:</strong> Teaching documents, such as this one on the Platform Overview All our docs are open source and we welcome contributions. If you see something wrong or missing, please open up a pull request and the Open edX Community will quickly take a look! You can use the GitHub button on the top of each page to open the source file in GitHub and suggest changes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>When you’re diving into code, take a minute to read each repo’s README file, rendered at the bottom of the repo homepage (here’s an <a href="https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a>). The READ ME will explain what the repo is for and information like how to develop, how to contribute, what types of toggles/settings there are, and more.</p>
