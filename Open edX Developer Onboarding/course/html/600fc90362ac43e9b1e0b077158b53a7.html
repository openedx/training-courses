<p>Once the domains and subdomains have been set up, you are ready to install the other system requirements. Tutor requires <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Engine</a>, libyaml development headers, and Python. <a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check Tutor</a> docs for details about which versions of Docker and Python are supported.</p>
<p>We assume that you have access to a fresh VM with Ubuntu Server (version 22.04 (LTS) or newer LTS) installed, ports 80 and 443 accessible from the internet, and DNS records set up.</p>
<p>If you are using a different operating system, you might have to adapt the steps below to work for your distribution. The Docker documentation contains <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation instructions </a>for a vast list of different operating systems. The method of installation and package names of Python 3, PIP, and libyaml dependencies can also be different if you’re using a different Linux distribution.</p>
<p>The first step is to install Docker Engine following the instructions “Install using the apt repository” from <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/%23install-using-the-repository&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1718837314727012&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UHjCOHf3MFp4oHNEpDCEZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Next </strong>we install python3, pip, and libyaml development headers:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip libyaml-dev</span></strong></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order to be able to run docker commands, the Linux user that you will use to run Tutor, needs to be added to the <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">docker</span> user group:</span></p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</span></strong></span></div>
<p>At this point, you should log out of your account, and log back in to make sure that your user environment gets properly reset.</p>
<p>Your VM is now fully prepared for Tutor.</p>
