<h3><strong>Developing plugins with Tutor </strong></h3>
<p>Tutor plugins are the officially recommended way of customizing the behaviour of Tutor. If Tutor does not do things the way you want, then your first reaction should not be to fork Tutor, but instead to figure out whether you can install or create a plugin that will allow you to achieve what you want.</p>
<p>You may be thinking that installing or creating a plugin might be overkill for your use case. It’s almost certainly not! The stable plugin API guarantees that your changes will keep working even after you upgrade from one major release to the next, with little to no extra work. Also, it allows you to distribute your changes to other users.</p>
<p>There are two ways to go about making plugins. For quick personal plugins, you can add Python modules directly to your local plugin root, as described here:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/tutorials/plugin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plugin Tutorial</a> (Tutor documentation)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>For more complex plugins that you may wish to share with others, the Plugin Coookiecutter can help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/overhangio/cookiecutter-tutor-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cookiecutter-tutor-plugin</a> (GitHub)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Of course, many plugins already exist, ready for you to install and use! Check out the <a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/plugins/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official plugin guide </a>for more details.</p>
