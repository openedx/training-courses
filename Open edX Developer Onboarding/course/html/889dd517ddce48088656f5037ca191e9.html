<h3><strong>Pre-requisites </strong></h3>
<p>You will need access to a supported server or virtual machine with enough RAM, compute power, and disk space for your specific needs. The VM should be configured so that it is accessible from the internet. See the <a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/install.html#requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor requirements page</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In our experience, most Open edX hosting providers choose to run their Open edX instances on a cloud server. Most cloud servers have multiple layers of security monitored by dedicated development teams and provide more reliable and consistent access as they are not affected by local power interruptions or catastrophic hardware failures. Popular choices for cloud providers include AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>You will also need access to the DNS settings of the domain that you will use for your instance. </p>
