<p>The Open edX project has over 200 repositories, and this course can’t possibly review all of them. This module highlighted the most frequently used ones, however, to learn more about the Open edX system, these additional repos are a good starting point:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/openedx/XBlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XBlock Source Code:</a> </strong>Reviewing the XBlock Source Code will make it easier to understand how XBlocks function; that knowledge will come in handy when debugging XBlock issues, either with your own blocks or others that may be installed on your instance.</li>
<li><a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architectural-decisions/oep-0050-hooks-extension-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hooks extension framework</strong></a>: Hooks provide a stable set of places in the code where functions defined via plugins can execute. For a list of hooks used in the Open edX system, check out <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openedx-events</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-filters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openedx-filters</a>. The initial implementation of the Hooks framework was driven by eduNEXT.</li>
<li><strong>New mobile apps:</strong> Recently the team at RaccoonGang has modernized our mobile applications and the Mobile App Working Group has additional enhancements planned. The current codebases are found in these GitHub:<a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-app-ios" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> iOS mobile app code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-app-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android mobile app code</a></li>
<li><strong>New data analytics tools:</strong> A cross section of teams at Axim, eduNEXT, Overhang.io, and OpenCraft have been developing <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-aspects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aspects</a>, an optional implementation of analytics for the Open edX LMS to replace Insights, which has been deprecated.</li>
<li><strong>The future of the Open edX platform?</strong> A team of OpenCraft and Axim engineers have been developing <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openedx-learning</a>, an effort to create a more nimble core learning platform, enabling rapid experimentation and drastic changes to the learner experience that are difficult to implement with Open edX today. This “modular learning” project is not ready for prime time; it is included here as a point of interest for those curious about where we might be heading over the next few years.</li>
