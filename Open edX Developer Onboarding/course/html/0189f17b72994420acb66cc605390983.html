<h3><strong>MFE Dev Tutorial </strong></h3>
<p>At the Open edX 2023 conference, Brian Smith &amp; Adolfo Brandes (both from Axim) gave a tutorial on MFE development. There was no video from the tutorial because it consisted of following instructions and the instructors walking around the room helping out. We encourage you to give the tutorial a try!</p>
<p>The materials for this tutorial live in 2 repositories. The <a href="https://github.com/brian-smith-tcril/mfe-workshop-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mfe-workshop-2023</a> repository contains instructions for setting up a development environment to work on Micro-Frontends. The <a href="https://github.com/brian-smith-tcril/frontend-app-workshop-example/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frontend-app-workshop-example repository</a> contains example applications.</p>
