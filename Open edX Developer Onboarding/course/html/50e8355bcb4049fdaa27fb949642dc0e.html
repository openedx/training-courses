<p>The Open edX system is very flexible, with a lot of different settings that configure various aspects of the installation – from configuring the databases, tying services together, to completely toggling certain features on or off. Some settings are required, but a large majority of them come with sensible defaults, either in the platform itself or provided by Tutor. Other than providing sensible defaults, Tutor also helps make configuring the installation easier by propagating shared settings to different parts of the system. For example, most MFE applications need to know the base URL of the LMS. Tutor automatically sets it up for all MFE applications through plugin templates so that you don’t have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Some settings are implemented as configuration values that have to be set in configuration files or as environment variables where changing the value requires a restart or redeployment of the affected services. But there is also a growing number of settings and toggles that can be modified at runtime from the Django admin panel, the traditional administrative portal for configuring an Open edX instance. The Django admin panel can be accessed at<strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"> </span></strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong>myinstance.com/admin</strong> </span><span style="font-size: 1em;">or via the Tutor plugin.</span></p>
