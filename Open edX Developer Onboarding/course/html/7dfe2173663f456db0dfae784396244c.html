<h3><strong>Writing a Roadmap Issue or Feature Request </strong></h3>
<p>Writing up a roadmap issue (functionality your team is planning to work on) or feature request (a feature you’d like to see, but are not currently planning to work on) seems easy at first, but it can be kind of tricky. For example, how do you write (for the purposes of communicating with somebody else who is not you, the person writing it right now) a feature ticket including acceptance criteria, technical requirements, and functional requirements?</p>
<p>We’ve tried to simplify the process of opening a roadmap issue or feature request by implementing <a href="https://github.com/openedx/platform-roadmap/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R<strong>oadmap Issue &amp; Feature Request Templates</strong></a>. When submitting a ticket, please fill out these fields with as much detail as you possibly can. After submitting, follow up in the comments section with any relevant screenshots, drawings, or mock-ups that we can use to understand your request. Again, you should read the full instructions for <strong><a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3875962884/DRAFT+How+to+submit+an+open+source+contribution+for+Product+Review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to submit an open source contribution for Product Review</a></strong> for up-to-date information on the process.</p>
<h4><strong>Here are some examples of well-written tickets:</strong></h4>
