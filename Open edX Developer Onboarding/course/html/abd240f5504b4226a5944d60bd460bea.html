<h3><strong>Terminology </strong></h3>
<p>Before we review the process of creating a fork and contributing code, letâ€™s clarify some of the terms used in this unit:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fork:</strong> On GitHub, fork means making a copy of a repo into your own account so that you have write permissions to push commits and branches to it. This is different from the broader open source term of forking a project because of a disagreement. We are talking about the gentle GitHub term, not the aggressive governance term.</li>
<li><strong>Upstream:</strong> The repository you are ultimately contributing to. The term upstream (and related term "downstream") refers to the flow of data. An upstream in open source is the source repository and project where contributions happen, and releases are made. The contributions flow from upstream to downstream. If you are new to open source software, you may find this- <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/what-open-source-upstream" target="_blank"><em>Red Hat blog about Upstreaming</em></a> useful.</li>
<li><strong>Remote:</strong> A server copy of a repository. A local repository on your machine can have a number of different remotes and pull from them separately. Each remote has a name and a URL. The default remote is called <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;">origin</span>. You can see your remotes' names and URLs with <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">git remote -v. </span></strong></li>
</ul>
