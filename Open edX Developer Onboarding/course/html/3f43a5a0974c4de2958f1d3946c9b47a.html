<p>Since MFEs can be developed independently of one another, it is possible for them to grow in ways that are visually inconsistent. One solution being implemented to address this problem is a pattern library:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Pattern libraries are the set of components upon which your site is built. Your site is essentially made up of pieces that act as a vocabulary upon which you can build your pages. These include forms, buttons, blocks of text, calls to action (CTAs), photo captions, etc. Good designers will ensure that within those components are consistent and reflect the brand properly in regard to typography, color usage, and other design treatments. (- <a href="https://kanopi.com/blog/what-is-a-pattern-library/" target="_blank">Kanopi.com</a>) </em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openedx/paragon" target="_blank">Paragon</a> is a pattern library that helps us to develop MFEs. It provides all the components that are required to develop the MFEs like Button, Dropdown, etc. You can view the current version of Paragon’s components <a href="https://paragon-openedx.netlify.app/" target="_blank">on Netlify</a>; you’ll see both how the component looks and behaves and the code you need to write to use that component.</p>

<p>Although using Paragon is not a hard requirement for any new MFEs coded for the Open edX software, it is strongly recommended. Paragon comes with a lot of advantages. Which advantages does Paragon have?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Provides consistency for your Paragon components</li>
<li>Provides scalability for your Paragon components</li>
<li>Paragon components are static (they never change)</li>
<li>Paragon is backed by a postgres database</li>
<li>Actual code examples are provided</li>
<li>Internationalization support is provided for your Paragon components</li>
<li>Accessibility support is provided for your Paragon components</li>
<li>Paragon decreases the time required to develop new features in your MFE</li>
<li>Paragon provides <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/tree-shaking" target="_blank">Tree shaking</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>(All except static, postgres, and optimization)</p>
<p>These features can be used out of the box in the MFEs. It helps to set a standard look and feel for all the components across the platform.</p>
