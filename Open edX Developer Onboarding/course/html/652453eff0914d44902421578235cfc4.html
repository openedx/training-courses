<p>After deciding which version to use, you’ll have to run a few commands to set up your environment. The provisioning part of the setup can vary for the latest Tutor releases, depending on how many breaking changes have been released in the latest Tutor versions. So for the version we selected, we first need to check the public Tutor documentation. Installing an Open edX stable release from the Python package manager PyPI:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">pip install ‘tutor[full]==X.Y.Z’</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<p>The argument full is an optional argument used by setuptools to install optional extra requirements, in our case, this means installing official plugins for Tutor like Tutor MFE, forum, minio, notes and more. If you want to know more about the official and contrib Tutor plugins, refer to the tutor plugins indexes. Tutor uses semantic versioning, where according to our example, X is the release or major version, Y is minor, and Z is the patch. Then, X.Y.Z is the version we want to install. The Tutor PyPI releases go from 12.x to 17.x. Each release version matches the alphabet position of the first letter of the Open edX release, so for the release Quince, that would be 17. See the Tutor documentation for more details. So, suppose I want to set up a Tutor Quince environment. In that case, I will run:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">pip install ‘tutor[full]&lt;18’ # or </span></strong></div>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">pip install ‘tutor[full]==17.x.y’</span></strong></div>
<p></p>
<p>I can change the versions depending on which specific version I want. If I must install the latest Tutor version for Quince, with its latest changes, I’d use option one. If I need a specific version, then I’d use option two. As mentioned, we use Tutor nightly to develop on top of the release branches. According to the Tutor docs, to install it, we should run:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">git clone --branch=main https://github.com/overhangio/tutor.git </span></strong></div>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">pip install -e ‘./tutor[full]’</span></strong></div>
<h4></h4>
<p><strong>NOTE: As of December 2024, Tutor branches have been renamed from "nightly" and "master" to "main" and "release". <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/t/tutor-branches-rename/14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See this forum post for more details.</a></strong></p>
