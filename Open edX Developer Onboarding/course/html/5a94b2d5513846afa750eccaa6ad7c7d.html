<h3><strong>Setting up the DNS entries for Kubernetes </strong></h3>
<p>Once you have access to your Kubernetes cluster, set up via <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;"><strong>kubectl</strong>,</span> you can start using the <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;"><strong>tutor k8s</strong></span> family of commands. The first thing that you need to do is to get the IP of the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">load balancer</a> which is the entry point into your cluster.</p>
<p>If your Kubernetes cluster doesn’t have an existing load balancer, Tutor can help you set up a <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caddy</a> instance, which acts as a load balancer service and is also responsible for obtaining SSL certificates for the (sub)domains that your Open edX instance requires. To set up a caddy load balancer with Tutor run:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;"><strong>tutor k8s start caddy</strong></span></div>
<p>Once the caddy instance is up and running, you can obtain its IP address by running:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco; color: #008000;"><strong>kubectl --namespace openedx get services/caddy</strong></span></div>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Once you get the IP, you need to set an <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">A</span> record that points your main (LMS) domain to it, and a wildcard <strong><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">CNAME</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1em;"> record that maps all subdomains to the main domain, just like we did in the local deployment example.</span></span></p>
