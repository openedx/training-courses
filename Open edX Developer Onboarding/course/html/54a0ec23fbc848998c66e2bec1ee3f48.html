<p>Now that you know how to create a fork, let’s review a few other Git commands that you are likely to use: <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">clone</span> </strong>and  <span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong>remote.</strong></span></p>
<h4><strong>1. git clone </strong></h4>
<p>The <strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">git clone</span></strong> command creates a local copy of a remote Git repository. It allows you to obtain the entire repository, including all its files, commit history, and branches, on your local machine. To locally clone the fork you made in the previous step, use this command:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><strong><span style="color: #008000; font-family: terminal, monaco;">$ git clone https://github.com/USER/edx-platform.git</span></strong></div>
<p>This command creates a new directory named ``edx-platform`` in your current location and clones the contents of the remote repository into it.</p>
