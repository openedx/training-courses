<p>In an open source project like the Open edX platform, documentation provides all community members with a common understanding of how each developer wrote their piece of the code and how all of the pieces of code work together. Good documentation provides clear directions and guidance to make any instance operate smoothly. The <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs.openedx.org</a> site contains main documentation on the Open edX system with different collections: for developers, documenters, educators, and system operators. Particularly, find the <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>The Open edX Community is actively updating &amp; migrating older documentation from a previous system into the <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs.openedx.org</a> site. Until that’s complete, you may find some of the <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the docs documentation</a> helpful (warning: it may be outdated). This older site was designed for course authors, but it may be helpful for you as you develop and test features.</p>
