<p><strong>Note for Later: Changing History </strong></p>
<p>You'll notice that there is not a direct path from f to f′: from the point of view of anyone else watching my-branch, the history has suddenly changed. In effect, c and d have been injected into my-branch's history, as if they had been there the entire time. Unlike most version control systems, Git allows you to change the history of your project -- but it is very cautious about letting you do so. We'll come back to this point later.</p>
