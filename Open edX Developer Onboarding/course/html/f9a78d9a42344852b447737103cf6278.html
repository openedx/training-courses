<h3><strong>The Ideal State </strong></h3>
<p>As you are working on any given Open edX repo, you will actually have a local repo with two remotes:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>“origin”</strong> will point to your personal fork in your account, and</li>
<li><strong> “upstream”</strong> will point to the repo in the openedx GitHub org.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>Very briefly, the normal flow for writing code contributed upstream will be:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Pull from the upstream into your fork to get the latest code.</li>
<li>Make a feature branch in your repo.</li>
<li>Make your changes, and commit them.</li>
<li>Push your branch to your fork (origin).</li>
<li>Make a pull request against upstream (more on this process in <a href="/jump_to_id/06ef878a245842b5afaf2b6733cad409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Module 5</a>)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The repository maintainers will then take a look at your pull request, providing review and helping you navigate the process.</p>
