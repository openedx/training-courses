<p>Tutor strives for simplicity and ease of use, and for that reason does not come with all the advanced capabilities that you might want if youâ€™re setting up a large Open edX instance.</p>
<p>For production-grade deployments, you will want to set up backups, monitoring, and cron jobs. Depending on the volume of your instance, you might also want to configure k8s autoscaling.</p>
<p>Tutor does not include these capabilities, but it instead encourages creating such add-ons using the <a href="https://docs.tutor.edly.io/plugins/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor plugin architecture</a>. A community supported set of add-ons for production environments is being developed under the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-k8s-harmony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harmony Project</a> (more on this later in this section).</p>
