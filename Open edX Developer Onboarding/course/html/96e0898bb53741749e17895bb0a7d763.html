<p>Once the DNS entries are set up, you can deploy and start your Open edX instance to Kubernetes by running:</p>
<div class="color-box" style="background-color: #eaf1f5;"><span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;"><strong><span style="color: #008000;">tutor k8s launch</span></strong></span></div>
<p></p>
<p>That’s it – once Kubernetes finishes setting up your resources, you have a running Open edX instance in a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.tutor.overhang.io/k8s.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tutor k8s documentation</a> to learn how to interact with and customize the resources in your instance.</p>
