    "Hi Everybody, Dave Cormier and Piotr Mitros. We&#39;re going to talk today about remediation", 
    "strategies and physics. And one of the things I feel really passionate about is there&#39;s", 
    "a lot of work to be done trying to help people get to square one with physics and I think", 
    "that technology will be able to help us a bit with that. We&#39;re going to talk to Piotr", 
    "about some of the ideas he has about some of the ways that some of the technology can", 
    "be used to do that. So one of the things you&#39;re always on about is about how people have misconceptions", 
    "about physics and certainly you can imagine a person in this room for instance who maybe", 
    "has some of those misconceptions, so can you talk about what some of those misconceptions", 
    "look like and how, like, what experience you&#39;ve had in trying to solve them and what some", 
    "of your ideas are about doing that.", 
    "So as an example of one misconception this is a common one if you&#39;re a teacher of physics", 
    "education research, I toss up this item, and I ask what the force on it is.", 
    "Hey you caught it. That&#39;s good.", 
    "And a lot of students have this intuition of force from their life and the concept in", 
    "physics means something very different.", 
    "Okay", 
    "So they think of the force as initially up, and then it stops, and then it&#39;s down.", 
    "Okay", 
    "So, it starts up and decreases over time. And in fact, the force is constant down, it.s", 
    "9.8 meters per second squared times the weight of the object.", 
    "Gravity! Is that gravity?", 
    "It is.", 
    "Yes!", 
    "So, one of the keys to teaching physics is to explain how to overcome these misconceptions.", 
    "Okay", 
    "And the technology has been proven effective in a number of ways to do that and there&#39;s", 
    "a number of ways we&#39;re exploring.", 
    "Okay", 
    "One way that has been proven very effective is to help students identify that they had", 
    "a misconception", 
    "Okay", 
    "So just something as simple as a student goes into a lecture and watches it, they can come", 
    "out hearing what they want to hear and what they think they know, rather than what&#39;s actually", 
    "said.", 
    "Right, okay.", 
    "So very simply assessing students on the way for their benefit, not necessarily for grades,", 
    "but for their benefit, they can recognize that they have a misconception.", 
    "Okay", 
    "While they have that misconception there are a number of things that can be done to address", 
    "that.", 
    "Okay", 
    "And here is where that kind of scale comes in very handy. So in our additional course", 
    "on circuits and electronics we had a discussion forum and in that discussion forum, if a student", 
    "had a problem they could ask a question.", 
    "Okay", 
    "And someone else would help them out.", 
    "Alright.", 
    "Over 90% of the questions got answered, the median time to answer was about 12 minutes.", 
    "So we got very rapid feedback.", 
    "That&#39;s pretty good.", 
    "And it turns out that that&#39;s not why the discussion forum was useful.", 
    "Okay", 
    "That is a good use for it, but a much better use is that it has a huge archive that students", 
    "can study of responses to student misconceptions.", 
    "Right, vicarious learning again from last week.", 
    "And students would look up existing answers.", 
    "Yes.", 
    "The number of threads that a student would read was a few hundred times greater than", 
    "the number of threads that a student would create.", 
    "Yeah, sure.", 
    "Much more reading going on than writing, that&#39;s part of the reason why these forums are scalable,", 
    "even to very large class sizes is because a student will typically see &quot;was this question", 
    "already asked?&quot; if the forum is well designed.", 
    "Yeah and I mean that&#39;s where the difference from the face-to-face classroom and the technology,", 
    "right? So maybe somebody asked that question in a face-to-face classroom, but there&#39;s no", 
    "way to go back to it. And that&#39;s one of the big advantages of the technology is that it", 
    "logs that into place and also from getting people to ask that stupid question, ya know?", 
    "We always say &#39;there&#39;s no such thing as a stupid question&#39;, even though I think sometimes", 
    "there are.", 
    "But someone out of a hundred students is likely to ask one.", 
    "Likely, yeah. And someone is likely is to ask a question, and think, giving more time,", 
    "is another advantage of the technology. Given more time, somebody can consider how they", 
    "want to ask that question in a way they might not feel comfortable doing so in a classroom.", 
    "And the answers we got, the types of remediation we had in 6.002x were fantastic, because there", 
    "was a 300-to-1 or 200-to-1 read-to-post ratio and because there was so many students, the", 
    "actual responses we got to student questions were far, far, far higher quality level than", 
    "the course could ever conceive of creating.", 
    "Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.", 
    "Yeah. So one of the key things here is that research is shared between the classrooms,", 
    "such as the discussion forums, allow us to build out this archive of interventions for", 
    "common misconceptions. Though one of things that you said that was interesting is that", 
    "in a classroom, you ask a question, there&#39;s no way to capture that.", 
    "Yeah", 
    "In fact, there appears to be ways to capture that.", 
    "Okay. So we&#39;ve done experiments with tutoring students", 
    "in classrooms and helping students in blended learning settings using tablet computers which", 
    "captures the audio.", 
    "Ahhh crafty!", 
    "And we&#39;ve been able to bring this technology to the point where instructors are comfortable", 
    "using it.", 
    "So what you&#39;re saying is, let me just walk this back, if I&#39;m an instructor in the classroom", 
    "and someone has a question, I can walk over with my tablet, for instance, and let&#39;s say", 
    "it&#39;s mine and I can say &quot;hey! the answer to your question is this and this and x over", 
    "a.. physics, physics, something&quot;", 
    "Well, you probably don&#39;t say the answer, you probably say think about this, or ask a leading", 
    "question, but yes.", 
    "But as you do that, you&#39;re going to have to, are you recording the audio as well?", 
    "Correct", 
    "Oh wow. So I&#39;m giving an answer now and it might pick up the things you write down and", 
    "also pick up the things you say and packages that.", 
    "Exactly.", 
    "Wow. That&#39;s really cool.", 
    "And if you like that, you can save it, and if you help a student that asks the same thing,", 
    "you can go back to this video. Now we haven&#39;t tried, we haven&#39;t closed the loop yet, capture", 
    "this, try this on additional students, see how much information is acquired, this is", 
    "very much a project in progress. Where we are right now is that we&#39;ve gotten the tablets", 
    "to the point where the instructors are comfortable using them.", 
    "If you have a smartboard, you could do that. Just think, hit record on the smartboard,", 
    "explain the answer, draw it out, save it and submit it to this course.", 
    "One of things that are very critical with this is the dialogue, what the student says", 
    "back.", 
    "Sure, oh what the student says back, as well as what the facilitator does.", 
    "In vicarious learning, yes. What happens in vicarious learning a lot, is that, let&#39;s say", 
    "you design a set a course. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a novice, watching expert video, you explain", 
    "course, I&#39;ll hear what I think. If I&#39;m watching a novice and an expert interacting, the expert", 
    "will say what the course is, and I&#39;ll say &quot;yes, that&#39;s what I think&quot; then the novice", 
    "will say &quot;here&#39;s what it is&quot; and I&#39;ll say &quot;yeah! that&#39;s exactly what I think!&quot; and then", 
    "you&#39;ll go &quot;no&quot; and that point is when I&#39;ll recognize, &quot;wait, I&#39;m saying the same as the", 
    "novice, I have a misconception.&quot;", 
    "Uh huh. That makes sense", 
    "So, that kind of tool capture is very helpful, but again, not critical. The point here, there&#39;s", 
    "sort of what we can do optimally in the future and what we can do practically today. And", 
    "even having very crude course captures of whatever a student needs at a given point", 
    "in time is much better than nothing at all.", 
    "Cool.", 
    "So another way we can be able to crowdsource this is something we&#39;ve actually done in course", 
    "at [...] is by allowing students to contribute hints in a narrower context. So if a student", 
    "answers a question and this was done in a course on mechanical engineering, the student", 
    "answers the question and gets a wrong answer and they later got a right answer, they could", 
    "contribute a hint. They were give that option.", 
    "Ah! Okay so, if I go and I do a question on mechanical something something, I miss it,", 
    "I miss it, I miss it, and I finally get it then I can say &quot;ah the thing I couldn&#39;t figure", 
    "out was this thing, so just do this thing, you&#39;ll get it&quot;", 
    "Yes", 
    "That kind of thing", 
    "And we got about 50 hints just about every single one of the hints was from a pedagogical", 
    "point of view, high quality. Many of them, in a MOOC setting, about 2/3rds of our population", 
    "was international, many of them had spelling or grammar errors, one or two of them were", 
    "even in a foreign language, so that was a problem, but aside from that, they were all", 
    "very high quality. Most of them were not things like &quot;you have this deep misconception, think", 
    "about this&quot; most were &quot;check your integration, you made a sine error&quot; that kind of relatively", 
    "basic thing but in education the goal is to maximize the amount of time that students", 
    "spends on constructive struggles, where they&#39;re confused and figuring stuff out. And if they&#39;re", 
    "struggling with algebra, that&#39;s not actually very conducive with learning, that&#39;s a waste", 
    "of time and reduces your efficacy. So that was another remediation strategy, where again", 
    "these kind of scale, if we can share things, share problems among classrooms we may be", 
    "able to build very rich remediation resources.", 
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", 
    "Those things are why instructors are teaching a physics course with a relatively common", 
    "structure, could I help your students some of the time and you could help my students", 
    "some of the time.", 
    "Okay, yeah", 
    "And do that 24/7, I don&#39;t if that will work.", 
    "Well, I mean, certainly more the people you have. And I mean, the beauty of what you&#39;re", 
    "trying to get done is that we know for a fact is that there are thousands of physics teachers", 
    "trying to get this stuff done. And even if it&#39;s not &quot;live asking questions&quot;, even just", 
    "having, you guys had a 12 minute response time in the course you were doing. Having", 
    "the ability of getting your answer back soonish, or being able to interact with somebody is", 
    "an awful better than what we&#39;re doing now. And it just seems that there are so many people", 
    "trying to get the same thing done that we should be able to leverage all these people", 
    "to help lots and lots more people.", 
    "And the number of common questions is tremendous, you get the first 12 or some questions, you&#39;ve", 
    "addressed about half of your students. And there&#39;s that very long tail of less common", 
    "questions, that if you want to get up to 95% you&#39;re going to get hundreds of questions.", 
    "So that&#39;s where it&#39;s also interesting in combining some of these very well deep remediations", 
    "for the first dozen, then student contribution, or other forms of crowd source for less common", 
    "ones.", 
    "And potentially, also, out towards the more complex stuff, which isn&#39;t really about having", 
    "an answer, but more so about engaging with people on concepts. Then there&#39;s room for", 
    "that as well. All we&#39;re saying.", 
    "Yeah peer learning is great.", 
    "There&#39;s these early misconceptions that we can do and some point that leaves more room", 
    "for the complex discussions because we&#39;re dealing with these things once instead of", 
    "a hundred times.", 
    "Yeah, so I&#39;m very excited about trying to do this, and trying the scale to do this,", 
    "we&#39;re really at the very early stages here.", 
    "That&#39;s great, cool. Thanks.", 
    "Thank you."
