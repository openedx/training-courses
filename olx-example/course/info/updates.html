<section><article><h2>September 17, 2014</h2><h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>This course module was created to give an understanding of the motivations and the core principles behind the edX platform. </p>

<p>In this first course module, we will explore some of the learning sciences that are foundational to the design of edXâ€™s core platform.</p>

<p>Start by filling out a <a href="https://edge.edx.org/courses/edX/edX_Insider/Ongoing/courseware/Profile/Profile/">profile page</a>. Are you still reading? Come back after it's filled out -- we need this quickly for peer group formation. Got it filled out? Continue onto the overview section to know what is expected of you, and what to expect from the course. </p>
    
<p>Once you have created your own profile, check out the profiles filled out by <a href="https://edge.edx.org/courses/edX/edX_Insider/Ongoing/courseware/Profile/Profile/">your peers</a>!</p>
    
<p><a href="https://edge.edx.org/courses/edX/edX_Insider/Ongoing/wiki/edX.edX_Insider.Ongoing/work-groups/">Please join a work group by Friday, September 26th.</a> These groups will work on an in-person exercise on Thursday, October 2nd.</p></article></section>
