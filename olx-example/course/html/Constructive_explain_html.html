<h2>Constructive Learning Explanation</h2>

<p>See what we did there? This was a pretty obvious multiple choice question, and you had infinite tries to get it right. The goal of that question wasn't to assess you or to challenge you. It was simply to make you figure out the information for yourself &mdash; either by considering your own experience (constructive learning), or by manipulating and interacting with the information if you got the answer wrong the first time (active learning). While there's no guarantee that you actually understood how you got to your answer (it's not a very good assessment tool) there is a fair chance that you now currently know the answer itself (it's a reasonable information delivery tool).</p>
<p>When the MITx platform was originally built out, it didn't include multiple choice questions. They're usually pretty poor choices for assessments. But actually, it turns out, they're often a wonderful choice for information delivery. There is substantial evidence that as we move up the spectrum from passive to active to constructive students learn more effectively. </p>
