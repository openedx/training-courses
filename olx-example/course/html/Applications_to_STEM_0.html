<h2>Applications to STEM</h2>

<p>What's really neat in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education are interactives.</p>
<p>A great example is a question designed by Marcello Pagano, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health, and Piotr Mitros. Marcello asked his students how they might evaluate hospitals for quality, and suggested mortality as a metric &mdash; how many people die out of a thousand. What do you think? Is that a good metric? What do you think happens?</p>
