<h2>Conclusion: Analogs</h2>

<p>Constructive learning, as designed into the edX platform, is designed to mimic some of the elements of a traditional tutoring interaction. Done well, a student either discovers information through problems and simulations, or is guided to a conclusion by asking questions. Some of this was based on ideas from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a> used in humanities education. Unlike many more open-ended interpretations of the Socratic method, edX's design generally leads students to a pre-defined conclusion. It also has analogs to techniques in management and influence that rely on asking questions to guide the person to a specific conclusion.</p>
<p>So, is this a good idea? Perhaps. Miki Chi has strong support for this, but there are contradictory research-based theories as well:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Here is an idea we often encounter: that people will learn better, with greater understanding, if they discover information for themselves, rather than being told this same information. Such an idea strikes a chord with many who as it represents a truism. Often, the reasoning is that the self is an active change agent. To discover something for ourselves entails deep and thoughtful processing that one is unlikely to forget. The more the self is involved, the deeper the processing. So if we can induce students to uncover or deduce knowledge for themselves, then the experiences made meaningful, memorable, and enjoyable.</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Such notions remain as myths that confuse the role of the self with the notion that the mind is active as it learns. There is no  contradiction between active information processing and learning from direct instruction. The idea that secure knowledge emanates automatically from personal discovery is flawed  and incorrect. We certainly enjoy solving puzzles. We find enquiry is highly motivating. But there is little basis to suggest that personal discovery within itself assists a person to actually learn.</blockquote>

<p>Constructive learning is one way &mdash; and a particularly effective way &mdash; to make the student more actively engaged in the learning process, but Hattie and Yates would argue that any way which can lead to similar levels of learning, so long as they involve similar levels of active information processing, can be as effective, or in many cases, more effective.</p>
