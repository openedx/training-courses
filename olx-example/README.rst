OLX Example Course
==================================

This is the OLX example course described in the `OLX documentation <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/educators/olx/front_matter/read_me.html>`.
It contains all the course content in an unzipped view. You can use it to:

* Inspect the OLX code
* Reviews the assets in the course

It should not be used to import into your Open edX instance. Use the tar.gz file in the top-level ``dist`` directory.
