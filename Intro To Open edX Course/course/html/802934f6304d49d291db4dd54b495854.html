<p>Open edX Proposals are foundational governance and architectural documents for the Open edX Community and codebase. The majority of Open edX Proposals - or, "OEPs" - pertain to the codebase: how major features should be architected, primarily. Some OEPs cover the <em>processes</em> by which our community operates: we have ones for Core Contributors, one for Maintainers, and one for the Core Product. Others are more technical in nature, meant for those who are coding Open edX software.</p>
<p>In more detail: an OEP is a document that details a specific technology or community decision being made by the Open edX community, in the form of a best practice, architecture design, or process adjustment. An OEP should provide the use cases and rationales that surround that choice. OEPs are not the only way for a change to be made to Open edX, however, the goal is to create a collection of OEP documents as a repository or knowledge archive of large and broadly relevant choices made for the platform.</p>
