<p>The Open edX project benefits from a wide variety of perspectives at all levels. Having an inclusive group of people participating in the project and helping to shape its direction directly leads to a more vibrant platform ecosystem that fosters stronger innovative collaboration within the Open edX community, increased velocity that accelerates platform advancement, and increased capacity to own and maintain all aspects of the platform.</p>

<p>The Open edX Core Contributor Program grants specific types of access rights to Open edX community members, which enables them to further the development and adoption of the Open edX platform. CCs earn these rights by sustained, active participation in the Open edX community and by following the “3 Cs”: Commitment, Conduct, Caliber. Core Contributors follow the Code of Conduct, are respectful of other community members, are polite and welcoming to all in the community, and have shown the ability to deliver high quality work over time.</p>
<p>Before becoming Core Contributors, they are members of the community who actively participate and contribute. There are many different <em>roles</em> that a Core Contributor can take, for example Code Contributor, Marketer, Translator, Product Manager, and more; CCs act in the capacity of the CC role they wish to take before becoming a CC. The benefits to becoming a CC is that you will have more ability to make decisions for the project - for example, you can merge code if you're a coder, or you are entrusted to make product decisions for the community as a product manager.</p>
<p>The Core Contributor program is defined in <a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0054-core-contributors.html" target="[object Object]">Open edX Proposal #54</a>, one of our community governance documents.</p>
