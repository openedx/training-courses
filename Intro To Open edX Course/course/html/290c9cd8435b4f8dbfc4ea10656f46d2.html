<p><span dir="auto" class="style-scope yt-formatted-string">At a basic level, Open edX is course management and online learning software that makes up the Open edX platform. It's open-source, so it can be used for your own online learning and teaching. Without owning edX a fee to use the software, so it's entirely free. You wouldn't also need permissions for us to use the software since we have released it for the public, and it's currently available on GitHub.</span></p>
<p><span dir="auto" class="style-scope yt-formatted-string">Many different types of organizations use Open edX software: universities, corporations, non-governmental organizations, even national governments.  It’s impossible to get an accurate count, but there are more than 1500 sites running 30,000 courses in more than 50 languages, from 110 countries around the world.</span></p>

<p><span dir="auto" class="style-scope yt-formatted-string">Open edX is an open-source learning platform created by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the most prominent online learning portal in the world – edx.org.<br /><br />It was created to fulfill the instructional design needs of various organizations to create engaging experiences that cover different topics, pursue other goals and use different learning scenarios. That’s why Open edX became so flexible and diverse.<br /><br />Open edX helps teach learners physics, maths, and even acoustics using engaging and interactive LMS features that are available straight out of the box. It also offers the ability to integrate multiple third-party systems like SCORM, LTI, iFrame. <br /></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open edX, the Open edX LMS, or the Open edX platform, is the technology platform created by edX and used to build the courses and run the core of the edx.org initiative. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after its inception, it was licensed as an open-source software product, enabling the possibility for other online learning initiatives to use it, even without being affiliated with edX.org, and furthermore, for more than 8 years edX planted the seeds of the Open edX community for practitioners and interested parties to gather and contribute to the advancement of the platform. <br /></span></p>
