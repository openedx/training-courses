<p>You may know GitHub as a tool for writing and sharing code. However, it also contains project management software, and is the way the Open edX project manages work. So if you're a coder, or a QA tester, or a Product Manager, or any other role, you'll find it useful to have a free GitHub account. Find our project at <a href="https://github.com/openedx" target="[object Object]">https://github.com/openedx</a>, where you can browse our source code in our many repositories. You can also see what we're up to on numerous project boards for working groups and other projects at <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects" target="[object Object]">https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects</a>.</p>
