<p>The committee is made up of 9 members, 3 appointed by Axim Collaborative, 3 appointed by 2U, Inc., and 3 members from the wider Open edX community.

<h3>Elections</h3>
<p>Each fall, the community comes together to hold elections for the three Open edX community TOC members. The first election was held in 2022. The process for the upcoming election in 2023 is still being worked out; when it's ready, we will post the details in this course, in the forums, and on the Open edX blog.</p>
