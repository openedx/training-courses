<h3>Coding Standards</h3>
<p>There are lots of coding and best practice standards that the Open edX project has, in order to keep code consistent, clean, and as free of bugs as possible. Many of these are broadly defined in OEPs (Open edX Enhancement Proposals) and ADRs (Architectural Decision Records). Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processes/oep-0010-proc-openedx-releases.html" target="[object Object]">OEP-10, Open edX Releases</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0013.html" target="[object Object]">OEP-13, API conventions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0049-django-app-patterns.html" target="[object Object]">OEP-49, Django App Patterns</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0051-bp-conventional-commits.html" target="[object Object]">OEP-51, Conventional Commits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of OEPs, and we don't expect you to read every single one. It's good to familiarize yourself with the site, and know to look to it as a resource when you're looking for major architectural guidance.</p>
<p>More specifically, some developer documentation we have are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/index.html" target="[object Object]">Developers home on docs.openedx.org</a></li>
</ul>
