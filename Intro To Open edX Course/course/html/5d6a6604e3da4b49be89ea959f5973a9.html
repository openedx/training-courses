<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Open edX Named Releases are named alphabetically after trees, starting with our first release, Aspen. This image shows a small selection of tree names we've used: Aspen, Dogwood, Ginkgo, Maple, Palm, and Redwood.</em></p>

<p>The Open edX community can share knowledge and improvements more easily when most people use the same stable, consistent version of the Open edX codebase. To that end, the Build-Test-Release working group creates “Open edX named releases”, which are distinct from the daily deployments to edx.org and have a longer release cycle (on the order of six months between each release). These releases will be tested by the Open edX community as part of the Build-Test-Release group's testing cycle. The release also benefits from being deployed multiple times a day to the edx.org website by the 2U/edX team.</p>
<h3>Release Mechanics</h3>
<p>Open edX releases are named alphabetically with botanical tree names. The first release, Aspen, was released in October 2014 and we've had numerous releases since then. Members of the Build Test Release working group gather together twice a year, in April and October, to define the release and thoroughly test it. The final products are released in June and December of each year.</p>
<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<p>New features of each release are highlighted on the <a href="https://openedx.org/category/blog/" target="[object Object]">Open edX Community Blog</a>. There are usually 4-6 blog posts per release that go into depth on the newest and coolest features.</p>
<p>You can find much more detailed information about current and past releases on the <a href="https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/community/release_notes/" target="[object Object]">Release Notes documentation site</a>. Release notes are collections of information detailing what's new in a release, what's been deprecated (that is, removed from the release), and information that site operators need to know to make sure their upgrades go OK. Release notes are compiled by members of the Build Test Release working group.</p>
<h3>Helping Out</h3>
<p>Creating and maintaining named releases is a HUGE job! The members of the Build-Test-Release working group would love to have more members of all backgrounds. Anyone can sign up to test the release with no experience required - although we also always seek more members who know certain features extremely well. We need project managers to help manage the testing plan and all the activities the group does. We need programmers - backend &amp; frontend - to fix bugs found in the release, review &amp; merge changes, and do the technical work of "cutting" the release branches. We need people who are good at English communication to help us draft and proofread the release notes and promotional blog posts.</p>
<p>You can find out more about Build Test Release by attending one of their meetings (see the information about the meeting calendar on <a href="https://openedx.org/wgs" target="[object Object]">https://openedx.org/wgs</a>) or by looking at their <a href="https://github.com/openedx/wg-build-test-release" target="[object Object]">home on GitHub</a>, which has documentation as well as a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/28/views/5" target="[object Object]">project board</a> where you can take a look at what types of work are currently being tackled.</p>
