<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"><a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/46793351/Open+edX+Working+Groups" target="_blank">Working Groups</a> are groups of like-minded individuals who gather together to work on and solve problems in various areas of the Open edX project. They are formed to collaborate on specific Open edX topics, including product, engineering, marketing, and translation.  Working groups are always looking for people interested in the same problems; you are free to attend any working group meeting as a guest, without committing to join the group. Of course, we'd love to have you join a group when you feel ready to do so!</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">We have many working groups, and are always adding and removing groups as fits community need. Here's a sample of a few groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Marketing working group focuses on marketing the Open edX project and driving connections between community members. They've been successful with putting on a monthly Open edX meetup with interesting and varied speakers. A subcommittee of this group also focuses on putting on the yearly Open edX conference.</li>
<li>The Build-Test-Release working group does two months of heavy lifting twice per year as they prep, test, and release a new Open edX Named Release. Expertise in any of the following areas would be more than welcome: coding/developing; written English for documentation; knowledge of platform features (to perform testing); project management (no technical experience required).</li>
<li>The Frontend working group is a collection of developers focused on moving forward the state of our frontend ecosystem. Particular focus is on standardization and improvement of MFEs, as well as which new ones to build and how to get them adopted. Developers interested in frontend architecture, MFEs, and/or Paragon will find this group interesting.</li>
</ul>
