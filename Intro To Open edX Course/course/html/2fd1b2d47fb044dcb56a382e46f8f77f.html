<p>The Open edX project has grown incredibly thanks to the joined efforts of Axim, edX and the open-source community. According to Sarina Canelake (Axim Collaborative Engineering team manager):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We've done a good job expanding the project to involve and serve a broad range of community members. Today it's still the case that the majority of developers on the project are from 2U, but the project as a whole involves the full community a lot more. We have open working groups and huge community participation. I get the sense that the community is starting to feel for the first time like the project is "theirs", collectively. Initiatives like Core Contributors have made it so the community is explicitly granted larger ownership of their areas. I think the Maintainers program will put more community members into the Maintainer role, which will continue that trend of more and more community confidence and ownership.</p>
<p>Previously, the project was very edX-focused and it was hard for edX to balance its own needs with those of the community when they were developing new features (or worse, deprecating old ones). Over time with leadership from Axim, the new Technology Oversight Committee, and growing community participation, that has shifted to more open processes (such as working groups like the Product or DEPR working groups), although there is a ways to go I think we've made a lot of progress here."</p>

<p>Now, more than ever, anyone interested in contributing to the project is welcome. Either by participating in a working group, contributing code to any of the project's repositories, or pushing items through the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/4/views/1" target="[object Object]">Open edX Roadmap</a>. Also, the improvements made technology-wise throughout the years have made the project - although bigger and more complex - easier to run.</p>
