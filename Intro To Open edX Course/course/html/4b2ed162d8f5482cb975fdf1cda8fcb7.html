<p>As you progress in the community, you'll hear a lot about "Axim", "edX", "2U" (and sometimes even, "tCRIL"). Who are these groups?</p>
<h3>Axim Collaborative (formerly "tCRIL")</h3>
<p><a href="https://axim.org/" target="[object Object]">Axim Collaborative</a> is the name for the nonprofit organization formerly known as edX. It stewards the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/" title="https://github.com/openedx/" data-renderer-mark="true" class="css-tgpl01">codebase</a> and community of the <a href="http://openedx.org/" title="http://openedx.org/" data-renderer-mark="true" class="css-tgpl01">Open edX Project</a>. </p>
<p>Axim is a nonprofit led by Harvard and MIT focused on inclusive learning and education. Axim will collaborate with educational institutions, governments, and other organizations to develop and evaluate new approaches to learning and pedagogy; invest in new learning models that combine the best of online and in-person; and promote the adoption of best practices across the education continuum.</p>
<p>Axim was formed as a result of the 2U acquisition, and was for a time called "The Center for Reimagining Learning (tCRIL)", which you may see references to occasionally. "Axim Collaborative" is the new name of tCRIL, and should be the only name used moving forward.</p>
<h3>edX, a 2U Company</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">At its website, edx.org, edX offers interactive online courses and MOOCs. The site edx.org is powered by the Open edX platform, which as mentioned before, was released as an open-source project in 2013.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">At the end of 2021, <a href="https://openedx.org/blog/2u-and-edx-complete-industry-redefining-combination/" target="[object Object]">2U acquired the business</a> (including the edX name and brand) to create one of the world's most comprehensive free-to-degree online learning platforms, reaching over 40 million learners globally. <span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text">e</span>dX and 2U look forward to continuing to work closely with the Open edX community, as a significant contributor of code and active community participant.</p>
<h3>Harvard &amp; MIT</h3>
<p>Harvard and MIT founded edX back in 2012. In addition to leading Axim Collaborative, members of each of these institutions are major contributors to the Open edX project.</p>
<h3>Open edX Providers</h3>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">There are many <a href="https://openedx.org/marketplace-category/open-edx-installation-and-hosting/" target="[object Object]">Open edX service providers</a>, each of whom offer a wide rage of services to organizations that adopt Open edX technology to build their digital learning experiences. These service providers offer services such as help with installing and hosting the platform (that is, running a site), customizing a site, and assisting with content development. You can browse the <a href="https://openedx.org/marketplace-category/open-edx-installation-and-hosting/" target="[object Object]">Open edX Marketplace</a> to see who some of these service providers are, and view which service(s) they provide.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">Many of these providers also contribute to the Open edX community - their members join various working groups and contribute code to the project (we'll talk more about this in the coming sections!).</p>
<h3>Contributors</h3>
<p>Contributions come from a huge number of community members - some are associated with larger companies, some come from very small companies or are individual contributors (unassociated with a particular employer). Many contributors are involved in one or more <a href="/jump_to_id/45e4bd12119e41d498442305050c6273" target="[object Object]">Open edX working groups</a>. Every single contributor and contribution matters! Our Core Contributor program recognizes those community members who've made a large impact on the project and continue to work hard to advance its mission. <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3156344833/Core+Contributors+to+the+Open+edX+Project" target="[object Object]">A list of current Core Contributors can be found here</a>.</p>
