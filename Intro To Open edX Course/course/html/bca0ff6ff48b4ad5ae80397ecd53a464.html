<h3><strong>How to Participate</strong></h3>
<p>The best way to start your journey to being a Core Contributor is getting involved in the community! A great place to start is joining a working group, making connections, and picking up tasks that need to be done. From there you can take on larger and harder tasks, earning credibility and demonstrating Conduct, Commitment, and Caliber.</p>
<p>The Core Contributors work together in a 2-week cycle (known as a <em>sprint</em>). They provide an async update that's available for anyone to read: search for "Async Update" in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/working-groups/core-contributors/36" target="[object Object]">Core Contributors section of the discussion forums</a>. There you'll find updates as to what everyone's working on and where they could use some help. You don't have to be a Core Contributor to offer help - just comment on the forum post! You can also meet other contributors (including, but not limited to, Core Contributors) at the monthly synchronous Contributor's Meetup.
