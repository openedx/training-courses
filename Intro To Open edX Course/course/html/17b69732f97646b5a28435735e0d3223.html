<li>2020: the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3143205354/Core+Contributor+Program" target="[object Object]">Core Contributor program</a> was founded, bringing the Open edX community closer to the project by empowering them to take the lead on projects and decisions that affected the project's software. In 2020, this program began with 9 coders.</li>
<li>2021: The Core Contributor program is expanded to have many roles that community members can fill, such as Translator, Product Manager, UI/UX designer, Marketing Specialist, Project Manager, and more!</li>
