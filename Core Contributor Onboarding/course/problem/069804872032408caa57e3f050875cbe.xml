<p>If there is <strong>not</strong> already an Axim Engineering onboarding ticket for your onboarding, file a <a href="https://github.com/openedx/axim-engineering/issues/new/choose">Axim Access/Config GitHub request</a> for adding access for yourself for whichever repo(s) you should get access to. Include a link to your nomination thread and tag the CC who nominated you.</p><p><em>Note: If someone, or you, have already filed an Axim Engineering request for your onboarding, access will be granted as part of that ticket.</em></p><p>After your access has been granted, be sure to remember to double-check your access by visiting each repository you were nominated to be a Core Contributor for and ensuring you have write access. This is easy to do by navigating to any open PR and checking that the "merge" button is visible underneath the automated test check reporting.</p><label>I have done this, or it has already been done.</label><choicegroup><choice correct="true"><div>OK, I'll double-check my access as soon as it's granted</div></choice><choice correct="false"><div>Nah, I'll just wait until there's a problem</div></choice></choicegroup></multiplechoiceresponse>
