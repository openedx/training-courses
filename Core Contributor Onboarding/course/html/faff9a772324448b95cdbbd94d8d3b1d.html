<p>The Golden Rule states, "Treat others the way you want to be treated", and that's exactly what we want to do in the Open edX project. This means treating everybody in the community with respect, listening to each other's viewpoints, and when disagreeing doing so kindly and respectfully.</p>
<p>Because you were just elected a Core Contributor, you already know this and have been exemplary in following the project's values. However we'd like to take a brief moment for a reminder about how we should behave, especially during pull request reviews.</p>
<ol>
<li>Always be kind and respectful in any communication. Avoid language that blames or shames individuals (for example, making someone feel bad about their ability to contribute). One easy way to do this is to try to not use the word "you" in review comments (although "You need to rebase your pull request" is fine!).</li>
<li>Set expectations at the beginning of review. If you are really busy, please indicate that it may take time for you to provide additional reviews.</li>
<li>When you find something wrong in someone's code, add an inline comment explaining what the effect of the line of code has and suggesting ways to rewrite or refactor to avoid the error. Focus on theÂ <em>effect</em> that the incorrect code has, not the person who wrote it.</li>
<li>When someone asks for help, do your best to direct them to resources (such as style guides, OEPs, language-specific resources, forum posts, and more) rather than saying "Google it".</li>
</ol>
<p>With your help, we can make the project welcoming to all. Growing the Open edX project ensures its health and longevity. Moreover, growing the number of people who can make code contributions helps us develop new features, fix bugs, and maintain our codebases better and faster.</p>
