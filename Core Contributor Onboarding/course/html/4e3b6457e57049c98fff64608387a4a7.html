<p>To start, let's define what we mean by "sprint". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint" target="[object Object]">Sprint</a>, in the tech community at least, denotes a one week to one month period of work where everyone sets goals at the beginning of the sprint and then evaluates their progress, as well as any issues that have come up, at the end of the sprint.</p>
<p>Within the CC program, we practice two week sprints, from one Monday through the following Friday, in an extremely lightweight format. Ultimately, we only ask that you roughly report the number of hours you've spent on Open edX projects during the sprint. That form will also have some optional boxes for you to report on things that went well, challenges you have had, and other ways you could use help.</p>
<p>We use a tool called <a href="https://app.listaflow.com">Listaflow</a> to do this report.</p>
<p>You will receive access to Listaflow by messaging Fox Danger Piacenti on the Open edX slack to request access. Please send him the link to your Core Contributor nomination thread from the forums.</p>
<p>We really do urge you to complete the hours reporting by EOD Thurs, every other week. We use the hours reporting in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>We look at a 6-month average of everyone's hours commitments to make sure everyone is participating in the program. This accounts for vacations and busy times in your main job. We're looking to make sure you are participating consistently, around the effort your peers are putting in, and in meeting with your company's <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3216900524/Revised+Declaration+of+Commitment+to+the+Core+Contributor+Program" target="[object Object]">commitment to the program</a>.</li>
<li>When CCs are found to have committed less than expected, the administrators will reach out for a conversation, seeking to understand what's going on with the CC and if there's ways we can help bring the contribution numbers up. We don't want to kick you out! We want to ensure you have the tools you need to succeed.</li>
<li>We use the aggregate contribution hours of all CCs to get a view of how much the community has contributed and how much it has accomplished. This is used in many discussions and is publicized in the annual Impact Report.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also publicize the results of the Listaflow survey in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/working-groups/core-contributors/36" target="[object Object]">Core Contributors section of the discussion forums</a>. Each sprint there is a new thread; take a look at the most recent sprint report to get a feel for what it looks like.</p>
<p>We encourage you to attend at least one Contributor's meetup! You can find the next one by looking at the <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y192ODZzaHJuZWdzaHNxZ3A0Zmoyazk0dTdiY0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t" target="[object Object]">shared Google calendar</a> for all the working groups.</p>
