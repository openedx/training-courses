<p>If you're looking for a few more ways to spend your Core Contributor hours, there are a few great places to find more Core Contributor work! These include:</p>
<p><strong>Working Groups</strong>: The previous unit gave a preview of what working groups exist. Time spent participating in Working Groups count as Core Contributor hours - as do any follow-up items you choose to work on. Working Groups tend to generate a bunch of to-do items!</p>
<p><b>Sprint Retrospectives</b>: Often, other CCs who need help will post in their Retrospective that they need help on various aspects of their projects. Retrospectives are posted in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/working-groups/core-contributors/36" target="[object Object]">Core Contributors section of the discussion forums</a> every other week, and are discussed in the biweekly Contributor's Discussion (<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y192ODZzaHJuZWdzaHNxZ3A0Zmoyazk0dTdiY0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t" target="[object Object]">see calendar of events here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Slack</strong>: All working group Slack rooms start with "wg-". Try posting in a room to see if there's a place you can help another team with.</p>
<p><strong>Roadmap</strong>: Take a look at what's going on with the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/4" target="[object Object]">Open edX roadmap</a> and see if there's anything interesting you'd like to be a part of! The Product WG is likely a good source of help here - <a href="https://openedx.slack.com/archives/C03AVP44R4L" target="[object Object]">reach out in Slack</a>.</p>
<p><b>Try something new</b>: Try taking on the responsibilities of another role! You don't have to be a Core Contributor in a new role for you to contribute hours - and those hours might actually lead to you becoming a CC in that new role.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a Marketing Core Contributor but find yourself also interested in defining and determining the direction of the Open edX platform, you might join the Product Working Group and begin taking on small product-related tasks. These count as CC hours! And, if you enjoy the work, you could decide to be nominated for a second CC role as Product Manager. A second CC role does not mean a double commitment - your overall commitment remains the same even if you hold more than one role.</p>
