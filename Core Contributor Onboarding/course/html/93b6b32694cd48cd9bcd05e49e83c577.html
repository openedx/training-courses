<p>The Core Contributor program grants you rights to the Open edX project beyond what is covered by an entity contribution agreement (the contribution agreement that an organization/company signs to cover the contributions made by their employees). Particularly, because you can act in the program at any time - even on time not being paid for by your employer - you must sign a personal Core Contributor Program Agreement and Individual Contributor License Agreement that attests that you personally take on the responsibilities your rights grant, including but not limited to committing code to the project and maintaining conduct befitting an ambassador of the project. It is a personal assignment and responsibility, even when the hours are provided by your employer.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> since the Core Contributor agreement is between <em>you and Axim</em>, you will not be automatically offboarded from being a Core Contributor when you leave your employer. You are welcome to continue your CC responsibilities; however, <strong>at any time, you can leave the CC program by <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3358261582/Core+Contributor+Offboarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following these offboarding instructions</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We will be asking all Core Contributors to sign an <a href="https://openedx.org/cla" target="[object Object]">Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Individual CLA")</a>. This agreement covers actions that you might take on GitHub that are not covered under the scope of agreement that your employer may have with Axim (known as an "Entity CLA"). Generally, this applies mostly to Coding CCs, however, this allows Axim to give you access to certain functionalities within GitHub (such as the ability to edit issues) that your role may require.</p>
<p>Please sign the individual CLA using this link: <a href="https://openedx.org/cla" target="[object Object]">https://openedx.org/cla</a>.</p>
<p>The personal CC Program Agreement will be sent to you via DocuSign after you've emailed <span style="font-family: terminal, monaco;">cc-program-admins@axim.org</span> with your personal (not work!) email address - for example, <span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">my-home-account@gmail.com</span> <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">, not <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">my-work-account@my-company.com</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Note that the CC Program Agreement covers all contributions made in the capacity of any role (coder, project manager, translator, etc) so you are free to pick up other types of responsibilities as you see fit, provided you go through the nomination process for the new role.</p>
<p>Please follow the checklist below to get started with your Core Contributor agreements.</p>
