<p>We've covered a lot of ground in this course! If you were to take away just a few things, these would be them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Contributors must always demonstrate the <strong>3C's</strong>: Commitment, Caliber, and Conduct. Consider "Collaborative Leadership" as a fourth C!</li>
<li>Don't be solitary! Collaborate with your fellow CCs, especially cross-role. Consider using Listaflow as a place to put out calls for help - or offers of assistance.</li>
<li>Many different things count as Core Contributor work, but your guiding principle should be that Core Contributor work is work that benefits the <em>whole community</em>, not simply you, your company, or your clients.</li>
<li>Working Group meetings &amp; associated follow-up work/projects, reviewing documents/pull requests/proposals, items on the Open edX roadmap, and working on documentation (of any sort - official docs, docs in code, docs on Confluence) are all great places to look to for impactful Core Contributor work.</li>
<li>You are always welcome to help work on things in areas you don't know well - this is the best way to learn and grow.</li>
<li>For coding CCs - expanding your repo domain can be done through both contributions to new repos as well as becoming a trusted code reviewer in those repos. So go forth and review things, even if you're not assigned!</li>
</ul>
