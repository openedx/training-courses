<p style="font-size: 16px;">There are plenty of core contributors out there looking for work. Do you need help with product or design/UX? Help from someone who's an expert in translations orÂ can help you assess the technical feasibility of a project you'd like to champion? Advertise that you need help!</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px;">The best way to advertise is via the sprint checkin in Listaflow. There is an optional box which asks, "Is there anything where you could use help from others? Or that you would like to collaborate on?". In that box detail what you're looking for. Link design documents, discussions, or any other useful material. Attend the Contributor's Meeting to discuss your needs in detail, if needed.</p>
