<p>The Core Contributor community is friendly, welcoming, and cooperative. We aim to sync our work via two-week retrospectives and do a read out every two weeks in the Contributor's Meetup to discuss ways to improve. As part of the retrospective we ask people to report their number of hours spent doing CC work so we can monitor the success of the program; we'll discuss this more in the coming sections.</p>
<p>Start getting involved today! Here's some things we'd love for you to do:</p>
