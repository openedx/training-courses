<p>There are plenty of core contributors out there looking for work - and not all of them are coders! Do you need help with product or design/UX? Help from someone who's an expert in translations or is good at feature QA and can help brainstorm a test plan? Advertise that you need help!</p>
<p>The best way to advertise is via the sprint checkin in Listaflow. There is an optional box which asks, "Is there anything where you could use help from others? Or that you would like to collaborate on?". In that box detail what you're looking for. Link design documents, PRs, or any other useful material. Attend the Contributor's Meeting to discuss your needs in detail, if needed.</p>
