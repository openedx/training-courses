<p>As a Core Contributor, there's lots of awesome things you get to do! CCs contribute to the project in various ways and are granted certain rights, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to independently own projects from start to finish (with community input along the way!</li>
<li>Elevated access to systems your role needs to access, such as Reviewer access in Transifex, code review &amp; commit rights to code repositories, or ability to change Open edX websites like the Marketing site</li>
<li>Establishing the future direction of the project, as well as maintaining and prioritizing work backlogs - working with the whole community to do so.</li>
<li>Growing the CC community by engaging with the selection process for new Core Contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone can join the CC program, regardless of organizational affiliation! We encourage you, in your new role as Core Contributor, to be on the lookout for future CC candidates. Work with them to help them grow their skills, and explain the program and benefits of joining, so they're ready to become a CC as soon as possible. Growing the program - and the community - is the best way to ensure the health and longevity of the Open edX project. A robust and large community is one that can achieve anything.</p>
<p>The following video is from a talk Xavier Antoviaque and Sarina Canelake gave at the 2022 Open edX Conference. This segment discusses what Core Contributors do; it may be stuff you already know, but would serve as a good reminder. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LsDaamDlaAhUEOgIw_DKKbqDRuXuWR2wOYClNVwYRm8/edit#slide=id.g11dbe83792e_0_0" target="[object Object]">Slides may be found here.</a></p>
