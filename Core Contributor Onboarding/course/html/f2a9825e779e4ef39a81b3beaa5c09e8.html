<p>As a Core Contributor, we expect you to contribute time and effort towards the advancement of the Open edX project - this means the community project, not projects that only benefit your team or company. For example, working on a feature that will be put in the community project does count; working on a feature that only your clients will see does not.</p>
<p>The commitment of your time, as a core contributor, is made by your organization - rather than just you as an individual. This is important to know, because if you find yourself with not enough time to dedicate to contribution work, you can use that organizational commitment to claim that additional time. That commitment was made in front of the whole community when your organization signed the <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3216900524/Revised+Declaration+of+Commitment+to+the+Core+Contributor+Program" target="[object Object]">Declaration of Commitment to the Core Contributor Program</a>. This signature from your organization means that they recognize that contributing to the overarching project that we all depend upon is ultimately more important for the business than even individual clients. </p>
<p>If you have consistent issues making your Core Contributor commitment, please reach out to the program administrators via cc-program-admins@axim.org. We are not interested in kicking you out. You have been chosen as a CC because of your high quality work, and we'd like to make sure you have the opportunity to shine.</p>
