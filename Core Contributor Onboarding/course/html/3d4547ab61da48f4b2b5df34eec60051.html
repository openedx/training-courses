<p>What other materials were useful to you as you grew in the Open edX community and participated enough to demonstrate your 3C's and become a Core Contributor? Include thoughts such as working groups, projects, resources, and people that helped you out.</p>
<p>This information helps us nurture the CC program and promote those things that the CC community has found to be the most valuable. Your responses may be featured in future sections of this unit, as well as in a separate "Intro to Open edX Contributing" course. Please provide your name only if you'd like to be associated with your answer, meaning you are available for others to ask you follow-up questions.</p>
