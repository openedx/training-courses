<p>The Open edX project highly values the accessibility (a11y) of our learning platform. Accessible software is software that can be used by any type of <em>assistive device</em> - from keyboard-only input to screen readers and surprisingly many additional ways that individuals can access the internet. The Open edX software complies with <a href="https://learn.essentialaccessibility.com/wcag-2.1-checklist" target="[object Object]">WCAG 2.1</a>, a comprehensive set of technical specifications as stated by the W3C to improve the accessibility of web content, websites, and web applications across all devices for people with a wide range of disabilities — including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech and visual disabilities.</p>

<p>We also value privacy and security on our platform. This includes things like being careful what information we collect from our users and how we use it.</p>

<p>With all this said, we have a desire for all people who interact with our community, build courseware, or help to build our website &amp; software to take an annual Accessibility training course and an annual Security &amp; Privacy training course. Currently, these courses are in the works and thus unavailable to take. They are mentioned here because we want you to be aware that this requirement will exist in the future; you will be receiving follow-up emails in the coming months announcing the compliance training and requesting that you take the time to complete it. (And yes, completing compliance training will count for your 20h/month commitment)</p>
