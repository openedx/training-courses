<p>The last thing we want to talk about today is leaving the program, but the facts are you may not be in the Open edX community forever. We understand that people have many demands on their time and sometimes life changes or even job changes may necessitate resigning from the program. Here's some brief notes on what to expect if you need to resign.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3358261582/Core+Contributor+Offboarding+Runbook" target="[object Object]">steps for resignation are on this wiki page</a>. In short, we request that you give us 30 days notice; if that is not possible, please let us know as soon as possible - email cc-program-admins@axim.org. Ensure all your access is terminated, and be sure to say Goodbye to everyone you worked with - individuals and working groups, as well as making an announcement in the #core-contributors Slack room.</p>
<p>We will be sad to see you go, but very thankful for the many contributions you have made as a Core Contributor!</p>
