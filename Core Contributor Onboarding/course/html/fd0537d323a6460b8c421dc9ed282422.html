<p><span style="font-size: 1em;">As a Core Contributor to one or more repos, you now have an additional responsibility towards the repo's health. This includes things like dependency upgrades, security fixes, and reviewing OSPRs. If you're not a maintainer in your repo, you are not directly responsible for these things; however, as part of your 20h/month commitment we encourage you to consider making the health of your repo a priority for at least some of those hours.</span></p>

We also recommend posting merges of risky changes (such as breaking changes, big migrations, etc) in the #risky-changes Slack room so that early deployers can be aware of your changes.</span></span></p>
