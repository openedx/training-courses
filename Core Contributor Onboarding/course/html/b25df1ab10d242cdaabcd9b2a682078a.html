<p>When you're deciding how to use your contributor hours, there's lots to choose from. Consider some of the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull request, ADR, &amp; OEP reviews (note: as a CC you are by default a core contributor to the open-edx-proposals repo. Make your opinions known!)</li>
<li>Working on new features (see the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/openedx/projects/4" target="[object Object]">Open edX roadmap</a> for inspiration)</li>
<li>Responding to the community in the forums or Slack - which may uncover some interesting to-do items not yet noted before</li>
<li>Working group attendance, participation, and execution on follow-up work</li>
<li>Cleaning up documentation (on Confluence, in the <a href="https://github.com/openedx/docs.openedx.org" target="[object Object]">docs.openedx.org</a> repo, or within your repos)</li>
<li>Looking at Sprint Retrospective threads in the <a href="https://discuss.openedx.org/c/working-groups/core-contributors/36" target="[object Object]">Core Contributors forum space</a> to see if anyone else is looking for help you can provide</li>
</ul>
