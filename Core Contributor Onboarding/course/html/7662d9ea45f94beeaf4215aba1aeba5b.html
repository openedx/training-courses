<p>Core Contributors are pillars of our community. You've become a Core Contributor by demonstrating the "3 C's":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong> - you are able to spend focused time on the project on a regular basis, shown over a large period of time;</li>
<li><strong>Conduct </strong>- Your conduct is consistent with the Open edX <a href="https://open.edx.org/code-of-conduct/" target="[object Object]">Code of Conduct</a>. You are open, friendly, and welcoming. When you receive constructive feedback, you listen to it and take it as a learning opportunity and a way to level up. You help and mentor junior members of the community.</li>
<li><strong>Caliber</strong> - You contributions are ones that consistently meet the bar of excellence in your given area.</li>
</ul>
<p>A fourth "C" might stand for <strong>Collaborative leadership.</strong> As a Core Contributor, we expect you to practice collaborative leadership, which is exemplified by working together, attending working groups, and/or sharing your work on Slack, forums, GitHub, Confluence, or other places. Collaborative leaders take feedback and direction from others; they do not unilaterally rule a team or project.</p>
<p>The following video is from a talk Xavier Antoviaque and Sarina Canelake gave at the 2022 Open edX Conference. This segment discusses the values that Core Contributors uphold, and how they practice those values within the community. It's aimed more towards aspiring Core Contributors and shouldn't cover anything you don't know, but refreshers are good for all of us. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LsDaamDlaAhUEOgIw_DKKbqDRuXuWR2wOYClNVwYRm8/edit#slide=id.g11dbe83792e_0_0" target="[object Object]">Slides may be found here.</a></p>
