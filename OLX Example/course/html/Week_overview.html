<p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

<p>This unit describes how we designed the edX platform to help bring constructive learning to education. There are a couple of motivations behind the creation of this course. First of all, it's helpful to understand pedagogical aspects of the platform because the edX platform should continue to promote effective teaching and learning. Second, as a deep dive, the design of constructive learning in the edX platform is a good example of how technology can use key concepts from the learning sciences. If this unit is effective, we may create future units on other key pedagogical principles applied to the design of the edX platform, such as mastery learning, rapid feedback, and gamification.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Understand constructive learning as designed into the edX platform.</li>
<li>Further your understanding of educational research.</li>
<li>Sketch how you would present a topic as a constructive learning sequence.</li>
<li>Think about how technology can work with other principles from the learning sciences.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Integrated Learning Sequences</strong></p>
<p>The edX platform was designed to use technology to create an active and constructive learning experience that actively engages students in learning. This is an alternative to simply having them watch videos, which is a much more passive mode of learning.</p>
<p>For example, each of the following steps describes a student who is more and more engaged in the learning process and learns more enjoyably and effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li>A student watches a long video.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watches a video with questions asked every 15 minutes to check understanding.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A student watches a sequence of 1-4 minute videos interspersed with problems, simulations, and discussions where the student is actively engaged in constructing their understanding of the material. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ICAP:</strong></p>
<p>The theory underlying this active learning approach to education comes from <a title="Michelene Chi" href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&amp;user=AlW99VQAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;cstart=20" target="_self">Michelene Chi</a>. Her work in education stretches back to the 1980s and the idea of active learning comes from her ICAP framework, which <a title="ICAP " href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mtchi/papers/Chi2008ActiveConstInteractive.pdf" target="_blank"> categorizes four different ways of learning: Passive, Active, Constructive, Interactive.</a> This categorization is a useful framework for discussing the design of the edX platform.</p>

<p><b>Meta</b>:
This module is a learning process... about learning processes. The first time most courses are run, they tend to be horrific due to a lack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Shulman#Pedagogical_content_knowledge_.28PCK.29">pedagogical
content knowledge</a> &mdash; an understanding of what aspects of the course are hard, what aspects are easy, how long things take, and similar questions about the course's design and content. Usually there is either <a href="http://theknowledgetransfercompany.typepad.com/introduction/2011/07/the-expert-blind-spot.html">an
expert blind spot</a> or an overcompensation for the possibility of one. We need your feedback. </p>

<p>Certain problems edX faces can be addressed using these ideas to come up with creative solutions, such as... </p>

<ul>
<li> 'Eating our own dogfood.' </li>
<li> Providing training resources for edX instructors.</li>
<li> Better onboarding for new edX employees around pedagogy, mission, technology, etc. </li>
<li> Internally disseminating what we know about learning. </li>
</ul>

<p>Your feedback is essential on: (1) How can this course improve? (2) Should this course evolve and be applied within edX? Outside edX? How?</p> 

<p>In addition, as we said, learning is an <i>active</i> process. You will learn much more from this course if you not only pay attention to the <i>content</i> of this course module but also to the <i>instructional design</i>. In next weeks meeting, we will ask you to <i>construct</i> feedback about this course. Generating this feedback will help you think about pedagogy and apply what you're learning. As you go through this module be careful to pay attention not just to the content of the module but also to the pedagogical and technological design. If you'd like to contribute more substantially, please make a <a href="https://github.com/pmitros/edX-Insider">pull request against the course on github</a>. </p>
