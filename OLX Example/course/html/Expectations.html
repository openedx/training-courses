<h2>Expectations and deadlines</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Midnight, Friday, September 19</b>: Fill out your profile page. At the next engineering team meeting, we will work in groups, and this will help group formation. (note: There is a small bug where you might need to hit refresh after uploading a profile photo; also there is an nginx limitation where uploads are limited to 4MB; apologies &mdash; the Profile XBlock launched 3 hours before the meeting). </li>
  <li> <b>COB, Thursday, September 25</b>: Group formation. 3 person groups (if we're odd, there may be four-person as well) </li>
  <li> <b>Midnight, Friday, September 26</b>: Finish this course (all segments marked as done). </li>
  <li> <b>Optional: Midnight, Tuesday, September 30</b>: Design a constructive learning sequence. </li>
  <li> <b>3-4pm, Thursday, October 2</b>: Engineering team meeting. Blended exercise.</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Intro: Discuss design of constructive learning sequences. (5-10 minutes) </li>
    <li> Exercise: In groups, mock up how you would design a platform to apply a new topic from learning sciences. (30-40 minutes)</li>
    <li> Readout: How was this experience? (10 minutes) </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p> We know you commit a great deal of time at work bettering the edX platform, but we hope you can find the time to complete the course material by these dates. The greater the participation, the more we can hope to improve this course for future use. Treat this with the same priority as any other engineering team meeting (with the exception that you participate asynchronously, at your own schedule). </p>
